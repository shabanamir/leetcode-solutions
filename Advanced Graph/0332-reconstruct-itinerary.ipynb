Reconstruct Itinerary </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWith JFK as the source (initial airport), we need to return the destinations (airports) in lexical (ascending) order. Solve it using a directed graph.\n\nCreate a graph with airports as nodes and tickets as edges and do DFS.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set res = a list for itinerary\n- create a hashmap  to represent the graph (adjacency list)\n    - *key = node*\n    - *value = list of neighbors*\n- sort the tickets in reverse order so that the smallest destination will be at the end\n- traverse the tickets and add edges to the graph\n    - for each source node, and destination node in the sorted edges (tickets)\n        - add an edge from the source node to the target node i.e add the destination node to the neighbors' list of the source node\n            - *(the tickets are sorted in reverse, so the neighbors will be added in descending order)*\n- define a helper function for DFS <br>\ndfs(node)\n    - loop until you find a node with no outgoing edges (neighbors)\n        - remove the last neighbor (smallest destination node) from the neighbors' list of the node and do DFS\n            - *(in this way, each time we will pop the smallest node, find the smallest destination node for it, and add it to the result list)*\n        - the node has no outgoing edges, add it to the result list\n- start DFS from the JFK\n- reverse the result list because we have constructed the itinerary in reverse and return it\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(sorting tickets (edges) + graph (adjacency list) creation + dfs + reversing result list) → O(ElogE + E + V + E + E) → O(ElogE) → O(nlogn)\n    - *V = total vertices or nodes = total airports*\n    - *E = total edges = total tickets = n*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(sort + graph  + dfs stack + result list) → O(E + V + E + V + E) → O(V + E) → O(E) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:\n        res = []\n        graph = defaultdict(list)\n        for src, dst in sorted(tickets, reverse=True):\n            graph[src].append(dst)\n        \n        def dfs(node: str) -> None:\n            while graph[node]:\n                dfs(graph[node].pop())\n            res.append(node)\n        \n        dfs('JFK')\n        return res[::-1]","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
