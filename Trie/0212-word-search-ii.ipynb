Treat each cell as the starting point and explore the adjacent cells on the board. If a word is found, add it to the result set and remove it from the trie. \n","\n","To avoid revisiting the same cell, mark it as visited before exploring its neighbors and unmark it after. For marking, either use a hash set or temporarily replace the cell letter with a special character (you can use any character except an English letter).\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","**Class TrieNode**\n","\n","**init()**\n","- set children = a hashmap to store the child nodes\n","    - *key = characters* \n","    - *value = child nodes*\n","- set end = none to track if the node is the last node (character) of a word.
