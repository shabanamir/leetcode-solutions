The quad tree represents a grid (2D array).\n","\n","Recursively divide the grid into 4 quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) and construct a quad tree for each quadrant. If all values in a quadrant are the same, create a leaf node. Else create a non-leaf node and set its children as the quad trees for each quadrant. \n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(n²logn)\n","    - *n² to check if all elements are same*\n","    - *logn to fill each level (n = n/2)*\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(logn)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\"\"\"\n","# Definition for a QuadTree node.\n","class Node:\n","    def __init__(self, val, isLeaf, topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight):\n","        self.val = val\n","        self.isLeaf = isLeaf\n","        self.topLeft = topLeft\n","        self.topRight = topRight\n","        self.bottomLeft = bottomLeft\n","        self.bottomRight = bottomRight\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","\n","class Solution:\n","\n","    def construct(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> 'Node':\n","        \n","        def dfs(n, r, c):\n","            same = True\n","            for i in range(n):\n","                for j in range(n):\n","                    if grid[r][c] != grid[r + i][c + j]:\n","                        same = False\n","                        break\n","            if same:\n","                return Node(grid[r][c], True)\n","            n = n // 2\n","            top_left = dfs(n, r, c)\n","            top_right = dfs(n , r , c + n)\n","            bottom_left = dfs(n , r + n , c)\n","            bottom_right = dfs(n , r + n , c + n)\n","            return Node(0, False, top_left, top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right)\n","\n","        return dfs(len(grid), 0, 0)"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
