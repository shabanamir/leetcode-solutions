Flip Equivalent Binary Trees </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-equivalent-binary-trees/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nTwo trees, A and B, are flip equivalent if:\n- root nodes have the same value and\n- left subtree of A is flip equivalent to the left subtree of B and right subtree of A is flip equivalent to the right subtree of B or\n- left subtree of A is flip equivalent to the right subtree of B and right subtree of A is flip equivalent to the left subtree of B\n\nDo DFS to traverse both trees simultaneously and check the nodes and subtrees.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- if both tree nodes are null, return true because they are flip equivalent\n- if only one node is null or the values of the nodes differ, return false because they are not flip equivalent\n- else both nodes are not null and have the same value, recursively check their subtrees and return the result\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(tree DFS) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(recursion stack) → O(max height) → O(h) → O(n)\n    - *height (h) depends on the tree structure, balanced tree height is logn and skewed tree height is n*\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# class TreeNode:\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.left = left\n#         self.right = right\n\n\nclass Solution:\n\n    def flipEquiv(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:\n        if not root1 and not root2:\n            return True\n        if not root1 or not root2 or root1.val != root2.val:\n            return False\n        return self.flipEquiv(root1.left, root2.left) and self.flipEquiv(root1.right, root2.right) or self.flipEquiv(root1.left, root2.right) and self.flipEquiv(root1.right, root2.left)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
