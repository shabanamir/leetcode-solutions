Return true if you reach a leaf node and the remaining sum is equal to 0.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n**Recursive Approach**\n- check base cases\n  - if current node is null, we have reached the end of the tree and not found the sum, return false\n- subtract current node value from the target sum to get remaining sum\n- if remaining sum is 0 and current node is a leaf node, return true\n- else check the left and right subtree\n\n**Iterative Approach**\n- check base cases\n  - if current node is null, we have reached the end of the tree and not found the sum, return false\n- create a stack and push the root node and remaining target as a pair\n- loop until the stack is empty i.e until the end of the tree\n    - pop stack top to get the current node and remaining sum\n    - if remaining sum is 0 and current node is a leaf node, return true\n    - push the left child and remaining sum to the stack\n    - push the right child and remaining sum to the stack\n- if the loop completes without returning true, there's no root-leaf path with target sum, return false\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: \n  - Recursive Approach O(tree DFS) → O(n)\n  - Iterative Approach O(tree DFS) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: \n  - Recursive Approach O(recursion stack) → O(h) → O(n)\n    - *height (h) depends on the tree structure, balanced tree height is logn and skewed tree height is n*\n  - Iterative Approach O(stack) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Definition for a binary tree node.\n# class TreeNode:\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.left = left\n#         self.right = right\n\n\nclass Solution:\n\n    def hasPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> bool:\n\n        # recursive\n        if not root:\n            return False\n        targetSum -= root.val\n        if targetSum == 0 and not root.left and not root.right:\n            return True\n        return self.hasPathSum(root.left, targetSum) or self.hasPathSum(root.right, targetSum)\n        \n        # iterative\n        if not root:\n            return False\n        stack = [(root, targetSum - root.val)]\n        while stack:\n            node, cur_sum = stack.pop()\n            if cur_sum == 0 and not node.left and not node.right:\n                return True\n            if node.left:\n                stack.append((node.left, cur_sum - node.left.val))\n            if node.right:\n                stack.append((node.right, cur_sum - node.right.val))\n        return False","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
