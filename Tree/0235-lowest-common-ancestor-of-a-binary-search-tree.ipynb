Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe have to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes p and q.\n\nTraverse the binary search tree (BST). If a node value is:\n- greater than p and q, then LCA lies on the left side of the node\n- smaller than p and q, then LCA lies on the right side \n- else the current node is the LCA \n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n**Recursive Approach**\n- if current node value is greater than p and q, search in the left subtree for LCA\n- if current node value is smaller than p and q, search in the right subtree for LCA\n- else the current node is the LCA, return it\n\n**Iterative Approach**\n- set cur = root to track the current node\n- loop until the end of the tree\n    - if current node value is greater than p and q, set cur to the left child to search in the left subtree for LCA\n    - if the current node value is smaller, set cur to the right child to search in the right subtree\n    - else the current node is the LCA, return it\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: \n  - Recursive Approach O(h) → O(n)\n  - Iterative Approach O(h) → O(n)\n  - *height (h) depends on the tree structure, balanced tree height is logn and skewed tree height is n*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: \n  - Recursive Approach O(recursion stack) → O(h) → O(n)\n  - Iterative Approach O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Definition for a binary tree node.\n# class TreeNode:\n#     def __init__(self, x):\n#         self.val = x\n#         self.left = None\n#         self.right = None\n\n\nclass Solution:\n\n    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':\n\n        # recursive\n        if root.val > p.val and root.val > q.val:\n            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)\n        if root.val < p.val and root.val < q.val:\n            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)\n        return root\n\n        # iterative\n        cur = root\n        while cur:\n            if cur.val > p.val and cur.val > q.val:\n                cur = cur.left\n            elif cur.val < p.val and cur.val < q.val:\n                cur = cur.right\n            else:\n                return cur","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
