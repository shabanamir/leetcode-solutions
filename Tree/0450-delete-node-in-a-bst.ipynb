Delete Node in a BST </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nSearch for the node in the tree. If the node to be deleted is a:\n- leaf node → remove it\n- node with a single child → replace it with the child node\n- node with 2 children → replace it with the minimum value node in the right subtree or the maximum value node in the left tree\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n    - if the root is null, we have reached the tree end, return null\n- if the node to be deleted is less than the current node, search for the node in the left subtree and delete it\n- if the node to be deleted is greater, search for the node in the right subtree and delete it\n- else current node is the node to be deleted\n    - if the current node has no child or only one child, return child node to replace current node  with the child node (if any)\n    - else the node has two children\n        - find the min value node in the right subtree\n        - replace the node with the min value node\n        - now there will be two same nodes but in bst, there are no duplicates. Delete the duplicate node (node that has the minimum value)\n- return the root\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(recursion) → O(h) → O(n)\n    - *height (h) depends on tree structure, balanced tree height is logn and skewed tree height is n*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(recursion stack) → O(h) → O(logn)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Definition for a binary tree node.\n# class TreeNode:\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.left = left\n#         self.right = right\n\n\nclass Solution:\n\n    def deleteNode(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], key: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:\n        if not root:\n            return None\n        if key < root.val:\n            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)\n        elif key > root.val:\n            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)\n        else:\n            if not root.left:\n                return root.right\n            elif not root.right:\n                return root.left\n            cur = root.right\n            while cur.left:\n                cur = cur.left\n            root.val = cur.val\n            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, root.val)\n        return root","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
