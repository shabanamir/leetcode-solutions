Check their left and right subtrees recursively. It will return true if both are identical and the nodes have the same value else false\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(min(tree1 size, tree2 size)) → O(min(m, n))\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(recursion stack) → O(min(tree1 height, tree2 height) → O(min(m, n))\n    - *height (h) depends on the tree structure, balanced tree height is logn and skewed tree height is n*\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Definition for a binary tree node.\n# class TreeNode:\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.left = left\n#         self.right = right\n\n\nclass Solution:\n\n    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:\n        if not p and not q:\n            return True\n        if not p or not q or p.val != q.val:\n            return False\n        return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
