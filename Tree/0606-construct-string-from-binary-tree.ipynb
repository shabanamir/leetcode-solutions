So, if a node has only right child, we need empty brackets () to indicate that the left child is null otherwise the right child would be considered as the left child.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- set res = an array to store the preorder traversal result. \n","    - *(don't use a string because adding to a string is expensive and in array it takes O(1) time)*\n","- define a helper function for DFS (preorder traversal) <br>\n","dfs(node, result array) \n","    - if the current node is null, return because we have reached the end of the tree/subtree\n","    - add the string form of the node value to the result array\n","    - if the node has a left child\n","        - add an opening bracket to the result array\n","        - recursively traverse the left child (subtree).
