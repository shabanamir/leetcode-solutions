Check Completeness of a Binary Tree </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nIn a complete binary tree\n  - all levels except the last are completely filled\n  - the last level may or may not be complete. If it is not complete, it is left-filled i.e there can't be a non-null node after a null node \n\nDo level order traversal (BFS) to check each level node. In the traversal, if we get a null node, all following nodes must be null. If they are not, the tree is not complete, and vice versa. \n\n# Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n  - if the tree is empty, return true because an empty tree is a complete tree\n      - *(no need to check this condition here because according to the constraints, the tree in the test cases is never empty)*\n- create a queue for BFS and add the root node\n- loop until q is empty i.e until the end of the tree\n    - pop q to get current level node\n    - if the node is not null\n      - add its left and right children to the q\n    - else node is null\n      - loop to check the remaining nodes in the q\n        - if any of the remaining nodes is not null\n            - return false because the tree is not complete\n- if the loop completes without returning false, the tree is complete, return true \n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(tree BFS) → O(total nodes) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(queue) → O(max width) → O(w) → O(n)\n    - *tree height and width depend on the tree structure*\n    - *in a balanced tree, the last level has max nodes*\n        - *w = 2$^h$ = balanced tree height is logn = 2$^{logn}$ = n*\n    - *in a skewed tree, each level has 1 node*\n        - *w = 1*\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Definition for a binary tree node.\n# class TreeNode:\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.left = left\n#         self.right = right\n\n\nclass Solution:\n\n    def isCompleteTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:\n        # if not root:\n        #     return True\n        q = deque([root])\n        while q:\n            cur = q.popleft()\n            if cur:\n                q.append(cur.left)\n                q.append(cur.right)\n            else: \n                while q:\n                    if q.popleft():\n                        return False\n        return True","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
