Traverse the tree and track the max value on the path. If a node value is greater or equal to the max value on the path, the node is a good node.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- define a helper function for DFS <br>\n","dfs(current node, max value on the current path)\n","    - check base cases\n","        - if current node is null, return 0\n","    - update the max value by taking the max of the current node value and the previous max value\n","    - count the good nodes in the left and right subtrees and return the current node count (1 if it is a good node else 0) + good nodes in the left subtree + good nodes in the right subtree\n","- start DFS to count good nodes in the tree and return the function result i.e good node count\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(tree DFS) → O(n)\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(recursion stack) → O(h) → O(n)\n","    - *height (h) depends on the tree structure, balanced tree height is logn and skewed tree height is n*\n","\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Definition for a binary tree node.\n","# class TreeNode:\n","#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n","#         self.val = val\n","#         self.left = left\n","#         self.right = right\n","\n","\n","class Solution:\n","\n","    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:\n","\n","        def dfs(node: Optional[TreeNode], max_val: int) -> int:\n","            if not node:\n","                return 0\n","            max_val = max(max_val, node.val)\n","            return (node.val >= max_val) + dfs(node.left, max_val) + dfs(node.right, max_val)\n","\n","        return dfs(root, root.val)"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
