Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-subsequences-that-satisfy-the-given-sum-condition/solutions/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nSort the array to easily check for the minimum and maximum element because the left elements are smaller and the right are greater.\n\nUse two-pointers, left and right. Choose an element from the left side as the minimum and find the maximum number on the right side where nums[l] + nums[r] ≤ target. If we can find such two numbers, we get a valid range. \n\nFind the valid ranges, and for each valid range find the total number of subsequences.\n\nNo. of subseq in a range l to r = 2$^{r - l}$\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set res = 0 to track the total number of subsequences\n- sort the array\n- set left pointer l = leftmost index, right pointer r = rightmost index\n- loop until left pointer <= right pointer to search for the valid subsequences\n    - if the sum of the minimum (left) and maximum (right) of the current range is greater than the target, the range is invalid because the max/right number is too big\n        - move the right pointer i.e decrement r\n    - else the sum is less or equal to the target, the range is valid\n        - compute the number of subsequences in the current range using the formula and add it to res\n        - move left pointer to search for other ranges\n- mod the result by 10$^9$ + 7 and return it\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(sort + loop + power) → O(nlogn + n + logn) → O(nlogn)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(sort) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def numSubseq(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n        res = 0\n        nums.sort()\n        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1\n        while l <= r:\n            if nums[l] + nums[r] > target:\n                r -= 1\n            else:\n                res += 1 << (r - l)   # or pow(2, r - l)\n                l += 1\n        return res % (10**9 + 7)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
