Trapping Rain Water </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWater can only be trapped if there are high blocks on both the left and right of the current block.<br>\namount of water trapped = current block height - min(max height on the left, max height on the right)\n\nUse two-pointers to find the minimum of the max height on the left and right. If left-max is smaller, find water trapped on the left side, else on the right.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base case\n    - if blocks are less than or equal to 2, no water can be trapped\n        - return 0 \n- set res = 0 to track the total water trapped\n- set left pointer l = leftmost index, right pointer r = rightmost index\n- set max_l = left block height, max_r = right block height to track the maximum heights on the left and right sides\n- loop until left pointer < right pointer to compare height and find the total water trapped\n    - if the maximum height on the left is smaller\n        - move the left pointer \n        - update max_l\n        - compute water trapped on the left side and add it to res\n    - else \n        - move the right pointer \n        - update max_r\n        - compute water trapped on the right side and add it to res\n- return res\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(loop) â†’ O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:\n        if len(height) <= 2:\n            return 0\n        res = 0 \n        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1\n        max_l, max_r = height[l], height[r]\n        while l < r:\n            if max_l < max_r:\n                l += 1\n                max_l = max(max_l, height[l])\n                res += max_l - height[l]\n            else:\n                r -= 1\n                max_r = max(max_r, height[r])\n                res += max_r - height[r]\n        return res","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
