Merge Strings Alternately </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nUse two pointers, one pointer for each string. Alternately choose the character from each string and move the pointers.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set res = an array to store the merged string characters\n    - *(use an array because string concatenation is expensive)*\n- set i = 0 to track the index in the string1 and j = 0 to track the index in string2\n    - *(we can also use one pointer but the code is clear this way)*\n- loop until one of the strings ends\n    - take a character from both strings one by one and add it to res\n    - increment pointers to move to the next character\n- if string1 is the longer string\n    - add its remaining characters to res\n- else add string2 remaining characters\n- convert the result array into a string and return it\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(loop + join) → O(min(string1, string2) + size of merged string) → O(min(m, n) + m + n) → O(m + n)\n    - *m = string1 size*\n    - *n = string2 size*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(result array) → O(size of the merged string) → O(m + n)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:\n        res = []\n        i, j = 0, 0\n        while i < len(word1) and j < len(word2):\n            res.append(word1[i])\n            res.append(word2[j])\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n        if len(word1) > len(word2):\n            res.append(word1[i:])\n        else:\n            res.append(word2[j:])\n        return ''.join(res)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
