Find K Closest Elements </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe need to find the crossover point before which elements are smaller or equal to x and after which elements are greater than x.\n\nThe array is sorted, use binary search to find the crossover point\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n    - if x <= first element, the first k elements are closest to x\n    - if x >= last element, last k elements are closest to x\n- set left pointer l = 0 and right pointer r = array size - k *(to keep the index inbound)*\n- do binary search i.e loop until l < r\n    - find midpoint \n    - if difference between x and mid value is greater than difference between x and right side value at index mid + k, the right side value is closer to x and k closest elements are on the right side\n        - move the left pointer\n    - else mid value is closer to x, the k closest elements are on the left side\n        - move the right pointer\n- return a list of k closest elements starting at index l and ending at index l + k\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(binary search + slicing to get the result list) → O(log$_2$(n-k) + k) → O(log(n-k) + k)\n    - *log$_2$ because in each iteration the array is divided by 2*\n    - *n - k because the right pointer starts at index n - k*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(result list) → O(k)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def findClosestElements(self, arr: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:\n        if x <= arr[0]:\n            return arr[:k]\n        if x >= arr[-1]:\n            return arr[len(arr) - k:]\n        l, r = 0, len(arr) - k\n        while l < r:\n            m = (l + r) // 2\n            if x - arr[m] > arr[m + k] - x:\n                l = m + 1\n            else:\n                r = m\n        return arr[l : l + k]","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
