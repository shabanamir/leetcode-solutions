Move the right pointer to find a valid window. When you get a valid window, move the left pointer to find a smaller window.\n","\n","Use a counter and hashmap to determine if the window is valid i.e contains all the required characters.  \n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- check base cases\n","    - if the length of t is greater than s, return an empty string because there's no way we can find a substring\n","- set need = a hashmap to count the required characters i.e characters in t\n","    - *either loop to fill the hashmap or use counter()*\n","- set have = 0 to track the required characters we currently have\n","- set start = invalid start index i.e -1, end = invalid end index i.e size of s to track the start and end of the minimum window \n","    - these pointers are to avoid slicing/creating substring\n","    - initially set to invalid indices to handle the case where no substring is found\n","- set left pointer l = 0, and right pointer r = 0 to track the left and right sides of the current window\n","- traverse the string s <br>\n","(you can use the right pointer r or any other pointer for traversal)\n","    - if current char count is greater than 0, it is a required character\n","        - increment have because we have found a required character\n","    - decrement the count of current character in the hashmap \n","    - while we have all the required characters, the current window is valid, search for a minimum window by removing characters from the left\n","        - if current window is smaller than previous\n","            - update start and end\n","        - increment the count of left character in the hashmap because we are removing a character from the window\n","        - if the left character count is greater than 0. it is a required character\n","            - decrement have because a required character is removed\n","        - move the left pointer\n","    - move the right pointer, *(will auto-update in for-loop)*\n","- if start is still -1, return an empty string because we have not found the substring, else return the minimum length substring starting at index start and ending at index end as the minimum window\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(finding character frequencies of string t + string s traversal) → O(n + m) → O(m + n)\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(hashmap) → O(unique characters in t) → (lowercase and uppercase english letters) → O(52) → O(1)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n","        if len(t) > len(s):\n","            return \"\"\n","        need = Counter(t)\n","        have = 0\n","        start, end = -1, len(s)\n","        l, r = 0, 0\n","        for r in range(len(s)):\n","            if need[s[r]] > 0:\n","                have += 1\n","            need[s[r]] -= 1\n","            while have == len(t):\n","                if r - l < end - start:\n","                    start = l\n","                    end = r + 1\n","                need[s[l]] += 1\n","                if need[s[l]] > 0:\n","                    have -= 1\n","                l += 1\n","        return '' if start == -1 else s[start:end]"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
