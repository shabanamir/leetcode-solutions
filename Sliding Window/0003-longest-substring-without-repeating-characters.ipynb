Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe need to find the max-size window (substring) without duplicates. \n\nUse a sliding window with a hash set. \n\nKeep track of the max size window. Slide the window whenever there is duplicate i.e char is present in the set. Else extend the window.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n    - if string size is 0 or 1, the longest substring without duplicates is the string itself\n        - return string size\n- set res = 0 to track the longest substring length \n- set seen = a hash set to check for duplicates \n- set left and right pointers, l = 0 and r = 0, to track the left and right sides of the window\n- traverse the string from start to end\n    - if current character is not present in the set, it is a duplicate\n        - add it to the set\n        - increment right pointer to extend the window\n        - update res by taking max of current window size and previous max window size\n    - else the character is a duplicate\n        - remove the left character from the set and move left pinter to slide the window\n- return res\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(loop) → O(input string size) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(hash set) → O(unique characters) → O(256) → O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:\n        if not s or len(s) == 1:\n            return len(s)\n        res = 0\n        seen = set()\n        l, r = 0, 0\n        while r < len(s):\n            if s[r] not in seen:\n                seen.add(s[r])\n                r += 1\n                res = max(res, r - l)\n            else:\n                seen.remove(s[l])\n                l += 1\n        return res","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
