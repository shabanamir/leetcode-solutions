Contains Duplicate II </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe need to search for a duplicate that is at k distance from its previous occurrence i.e a window of size k where the start and end elements are the same.\n\nUse a hashmap to search for the duplicate and its distance. \n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set seen = a hashmap to store the seen numbers and their indices\n    - *key = number*\n    - *value = index*\n- traverse the array\n    - if the current number is in the hashmap and the distance between its current and previous occurrence index <= k, the current number is a duplicate\n        - return true\n    - else add the number and its index to the hashmap\n- if the loop completes without returning true, there's no duplicate, return false\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(array traversal) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(hashmap) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def containsNearbyDuplicate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:\n        seen = {}\n        for i, n in enumerate(nums):\n            if n in seen and i - seen[n] <= k:\n                return True\n            seen[n] = i\n        return False","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
