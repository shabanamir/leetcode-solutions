Sliding Window Maximum </center>\n","\n","\n","## Problem Description\n","[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/description/)\n","\n","\n","## Intuition\n","<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\n","We need to find the maximum of all subarrays of size k. \n","\n","Each time, slide the window and add the max value to the result. To get the max element in a window of size k, we can use:\n","- linear search O(k)\n","- max heap O(logk)\n","- double-ended queue O(1) time\n","\n","Deque allows insertion and deletion at both ends in O(1) time. We will keep the largest elements of the current window at the front/left end and smallest elements at the rear/right end of the deque.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- check base cases\n","    - if k is 1, return the input array \n","    - if k is equal to the length of the array, return the max of the input array\n","- se dq = a deque to store the indices of the current window elements for tracking the max value\n","- set res = a list to store the max value in each window\n","- set left pointer l = 0 and right pointer r = 0 to track the left and right sides of the window\n","- traverses the array <br>\n","(you can use the right pointer r or any other pointer for traversal)\n","    - while the current number is greater than the last inserted number in the dq, pop dq to remove all smaller element indices \n","    - insert the index of the current number in the dq\n","    - if current window is valid\n","        - add the max element (leftmost index element) to the res\n","        - move left pointer\n","    - if l is greater than the leftmost index in the dq, remove an element from the left because that element is no longer part of the current window\n","    - move right pointer, *(will auto update in for-loop)*\n","- return res\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(traversal) → O(n)\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(deque) → O(window size) → O(k)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","    \n","    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:\n","        if k == 1:\n","            return nums\n","        if k == len(nums):\n","            return [max(nums)]\n","        dq = deque()\n","        res = []\n","        l = 0\n","        for r in range(len(nums)):\n","            while dq and nums[dq[-1]] < nums[r]:\n","                dq.pop()\n","            dq.append(r)\n","            if r + 1 >= k:\n","                res.append(nums[dq[0]])\n","                l += 1\n","            if l > dq[0]:\n","                dq.popleft()\n","        return res"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
