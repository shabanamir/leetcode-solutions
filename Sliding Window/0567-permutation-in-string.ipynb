Permutation in String </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nIt is the same as [Find all anagrams in a string](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/description/). The difference is here we have to find just one anagram (permutation).\n\nOne string is a permutation of another string if both have the same character frequencies. Use a hashmap to store the required character frequencies, and a sliding window to search for a window (substring) of size s1 in string s2.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n    - if s1 size is greater than s2, return false because there's no way we can find a permutation of s1 in s2\n- set count = a hashmap to store character frequencies of s1 for tracking the required characters\n    - *either loop to fill the hashmap or use Counter()*\n- set left pointer l = 0 and right pointer r = 0 to track the left and right sides of the window\n- traverse the characters in string s2\n    - if current character count is greater than 0, it is a required character\n        - decrement its count because we have found a required character and it is a part of the current window\n          - *(remember the rule: decrement count of character if it gets inside the window and increment if it gets outside)*\n        - if the current window size is the same as s1, we have found the permutation, return True\n        - else we have not found all the required characters, move the right pointer to include more characters in the window\n    - if left and right pointers are in the same position\n      - move both pointers\n    - else the current window is not valid because the current character count is 0 i.e it is not part of the permutation. We need to slide the window by removing a character from the left\n      - add the left character back to the hashmap because it is a required character and we have removed it\n          - *(remember the rule)*\n      - move the left pointer   \n- if the loop completes without returning true, there is no permutation, return false\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(counting frequencies in string1 + string2 traversal) → O(m + n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(hashmap) → O(unique characters in string1) → O(lowercase english letters) → O(26) → O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def checkInclusion(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\n        if len(s1) > len(s2):\n            return False\n        count = Counter(s1)\n        l, r = 0, 0\n        while r < len(s2):\n            if count[s2[r]] > 0:\n                count[s2[r]] -= 1\n                if r - l + 1 == len(s1):\n                    return True\n                r += 1\n            elif l == r:\n                l += 1\n                r += 1\n            else:\n                count[s2[l]] += 1\n                l += 1\n        return False","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
