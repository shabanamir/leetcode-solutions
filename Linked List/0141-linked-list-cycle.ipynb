Linked List Cycle </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nUse slow-fast pointer algorithm. \n\nTraverse linked list using two pointers (slow and fast). Move the slow pointer one step and the fast two steps at a time. There's a cycle if the slow pointer reaches the fast.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set both pointers at the start of the list i.e head node\n- loop until the fast pointer reaches the end of the list\n    - move slow pointer one node forward\n    - move fast pointer two nodes forward\n    - if slow and fast meet, return true because there's a cycle\n- if the loop completes without returning true, there's no cycle, return false\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(loop) → O(half of the list) → O(n / 2) → O(n)\n  - *half of the list because we are moving fast pointer two nodes at a time*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(total new nodes created) → O(0) → O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Definition for singly-linked list.\n# class ListNode:\n#     def __init__(self, x):\n#         self.val = x\n#         self.next = None\n\n\nclass Solution:\n\n    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:\n        slow, fast = head, head\n        while fast and fast.next:\n            slow = slow.next\n            fast = fast.next.next\n            if slow == fast:\n                return True\n        return False","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
