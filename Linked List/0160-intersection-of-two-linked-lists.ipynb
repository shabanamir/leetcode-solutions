Intersection of Two Linked Lists </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\n1. O(n) space <br>\nTraverse the first list and mark its nodes visited by adding them to a hashset. Traverse the second list, if a node is already present in the set, it is the intersection node.\n2. O(1) space <br>\nTraverse both nodes in parallel using two-pointers. If list1 pointer reaches the end, redirect it to list2 head and vice-versa. Once both pointers are re-assigned, they will be equidistant from the intersection node.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set i = head of list1 to track and traverse nodes in list1\n- set j = head of list2 to track and traverse nodes in list2\n- loop until the nodes pointed by i and j are not the same\n    - if we have not reached list1 end\n        - update i to move forward in list1 \n    - else reset i to the head of list2\n    - if we have not reached list2 end\n        - update j to move forward in list2 \n    - else reset j to head of list1\n- return i or j \n    - *(because both will point to the same node)*\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(loop) →  O(m + n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(total new nodes created) → O(0) → O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Definition for singly-linked list.\n# class ListNode:\n#     def __init__(self, x):\n#         self.val = x\n#         self.next = None\n\n\nclass Solution:\n\n    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:\n        i, j = headA, headB\n        while i != j:\n            i = i.next if i else headB\n            j = j.next if j else headA\n        return i","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
