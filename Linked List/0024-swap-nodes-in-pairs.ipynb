Swap Nodes in Pairs </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nTwo ways to solve this:\n1. move two nodes forward at a time and swap adjacent node values if the values are not equal.\n2. move two nodes forward at a time and swap adjacent nodes by updating the next pointer\n\nNote: Use approach 2, because it is stated in the description not to change the values.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n  - if the list is empty or there's a single node in the list, return\n- create a dummy node and set its next pointer to head to track the modified list head\n- set cur = dummy to traverse the list and track current node\n- loop until the second last node\n    - take two nodes\n    first = 1st node of the pair = cur.next\n    second = 2nd node of the pair = cur.next.next\n    - connect the first node with the third node by setting the first node next to the second node next\n    - make the first node as second node by setting the second node next to the first node\n    - make the second node as first node by setting the current node next to the second node\n    - move the cur pointer two nodes ahead because we have swapped two nodes\n- return dummy.next as the modified list head\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity:  O(loop) → O(n - 2) → O(n)\n    - *we loop until the second last node*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(total new nodes created) → O(1) → O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Definition for singly-linked list.\n# class ListNode:\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.next = next\n\n\nclass Solution:\n\n    def swapPairs(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:\n        if not head or not head.next: \n            return head\n\n        # swap nodes \n        dummy = ListNode(None, head)\n        cur = dummy\n        while cur.next and cur.next.next:\n            first = cur.next\n            second = cur.next.next\n            first.next = second.next\n            second.next = first\n            cur.next = second\n            cur = cur.next.next\n        return dummy.next\n\n        # swap values\n        # cur = head\n        # while cur and cur.next:\n        #     if cur.val != cur.next.val:\n        #         cur.val, cur.next.val = cur.next.val, cur.val\n        #     cur = cur.next.next\n        # return head","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
