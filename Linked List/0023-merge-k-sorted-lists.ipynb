Merge k Sorted Lists </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nThis is same as [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/). \n\nUse the divide and conquer approach.\n\nEach time take two sorted lists and merge them into one list. Repeat this until all the lists are merged.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n    - if the input contains no lists i.e [] or contains empty lists i.e [[], []], return null\n    - if there's only one list, return it\n    - if there are only two lists, merge them \n- set k = number of lists to be merged\n- loop until all lists are merged i.e loop until k is zero\n    - set left pointer l = 0 and right pointer r = k\n    - loop until l < r\n        - take two sorted lists (left and right lists), merge them using [Merge Two Sorted Lists Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/solutions/3604740/o-min-m-n-time-o-1-space-solution-explained/) and store the merged list in the left list place\n        - increment l and decrement r to get the next pair\n    - divide k by 2 because each time we merge k lists into k/2 lists i.e k/2 lists are left to be merged\n- return the first list as it contains the k merged list\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(outer loop * inner loop * merging two sorted lists) → O(logk * constt * n) → O(logk * n) → O(nlogk)\n  - *the outer loop will run logk times because in each iteration, k is divided by 2*\n  - *the inner loop iteration is not fixed <br> \n  for example, if k is 8 <br>\nthe outer loop will run log(k) = log(8) = 3 times <br>\nthe inner loop will run 8 times for the first outer loop iteration, 4 times for the second iteration, and 2 times for the third iteration*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(total new nodes created) → O(k)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Definition for singly-linked list.\n# class ListNode:\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.next = next\n\n\nclass Solution:\n\n    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:\n        if not lists or not any(lists):\n            return None\n        if len(lists) == 1:\n            return lists[0]\n        if len(lists) == 2:\n            return self.merge_sorted_lists(lists[0], lists[1])\n        k = len(lists) - 1\n        while k:\n            l, r = 0, k\n            while l < r:\n                lists[l] = self.merge_sorted_lists(lists[l], lists[r])\n                l += 1\n                r -= 1\n            k //= 2\n        return lists[0]\n\n    def merge_sorted_lists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:\n        if not list1:\n            return list2\n        if not list2:\n            return list1\n        head = ListNode()\n        cur = head\n        while list1 and list2:\n            if list1.val < list2.val:\n                cur.next = list1\n                list1 = list1.next\n            else:\n                cur.next = list2\n                list2 = list2.next\n            cur = cur.next\n        cur.next = list1 or list2\n        return head.next","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
