Remove Nth Node From End of List </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nTo remove the nth node from end, we need to update the next pointer of its previous nodes i.e (n+1)th node from the end. In a singly linked list, we can't move in backward direction (end to start) to find the nth node from end.\n\nApproaches:\n1. The nth node from end is the same as (total nodes - n)th node from start. But for this, we need to find the list size (total nodes), which will require an extra pass/loop.\n2. Use slow-fast pointer approach. Give the fast pointer an earlier start by moving it to (n+1)th node from the start. Then move both pointers at the same pace. By the time, fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at (n+1)th node from end.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set slow and fast pointers at the start of the list\n- loop n times to move the fast pointer (n+1)th node from the start \n    - *(the range is n but due to next pointer, the fast pointer will point to (n+1)th node)*\n- if the fast pointer becomes null, it means the first node is the target node\n    - delete it by returning the second node as start of the list i.e head.next \n- loop until the fast pointer reaches the end\n    - move both pointers one node at a time\n- after the loop, the slow pointer will be at (n+1)th node from the end. update its next pointer to remove the next node i.e nth node\n- return head\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(moving fast pointer till (n+1)th node + moving fast pointer til last node) → O(n + total nodes - n) → O(n + m - n) → O(m) \n    - *m >= n*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(total new nodes created) → O(0) → O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Definition for singly-linked list.\n# class ListNode:\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.next = next\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    \n    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:\n        slow = fast = head\n        for _ in range(n):\n            fast = fast.next\n        if not fast:\n            return head.next\n        while fast.next:\n            slow = slow.next\n            fast = fast.next\n        slow.next = slow.next.next\n        return head","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
