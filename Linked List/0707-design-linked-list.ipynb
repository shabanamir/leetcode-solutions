return -1\n","- set the current node pointer to the head node\n","- loop index times and move the current node ahead to reach the node at the required index and return the value\n","\n","**addAtHead()**\n","- insert a node at the start (index 0) with the specified value\n","\n","**addAtTail()**\n","- insert a node at the end (index = linked list length) with the specified value\n","\n","**addAtIndex()**\n","- if the index is out of bound\n","    -
