Reorder List </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe need to re-order the list by placing the first half (left) and second half (right) nodes alternately. \n\nfirst node → last node → second node → second last node and so on\n\nWe can use a two-pointer approach to traverse the two halves and place nodes alternately. The problem is that in singly linked list we can only move forward not backward unlike a list (array). To solve this, reverse the second half of the list. \n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n    - if there's only one node in the list, return\n- find the middle of the list using slow-fast pointer algorithm\n    - set two pointers slow and fast at the start of the list\n    - move slow one step and fast two steps at a time\n    - by the time fast reaches the end, slow reaches the middle of the list\n- reverse the second half using pointers\n    - set prev = null to track the previous node\n    - set cur = start node of the second half i.e slow (we can continue with the slow pointer but the code is clear this way)\n    - loop until the last node\n        - store the next node in next pointer\n        - make the previous node as the next node of the current node\n        - make the current node as the previous node and next node as the current node\n- place the nodes alternatively using left and right pointers\n    - set left = second node of first half i.e head.next\n        - *(second node because first left node (head) is correctly place)*\n    - set right = start node of reversed second half i.e prev\n    - set i = 1 to track the even and odd iteration\n        - *(we need to put left nodes in even positions and right nodes in odd)*\n    - loop until the left and right nodes meet\n        - if iteration is odd\n            - put the right node and move right pointer\n        - if iteration is even\n            - put the left node and move left pointer\n        - move head\n        - increment i\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(finding middle + reversing second half + connecting left and right nodes) → O(n/2 + n/2 + n/2) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(total new nodes created) → O(0) → O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Definition for singly-linked list.\n# class ListNode:\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.next = next\n\n\nclass Solution:\n\n    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.\n        \"\"\"\n        if not head.next:\n            return\n        \n        # find middle \n        slow, fast = head, head\n        while fast and fast.next:\n            slow = slow.next\n            fast = fast.next.next\n        \n        # reverse second half\n        prev, cur = None, slow\n        while cur:\n            next = cur.next\n            cur.next = prev\n            prev = cur\n            cur = next\n        \n        # place first and second half nodes alternately \n        l, r = head.next, prev\n        i = 1\n        while l != r:\n            if i & 1:\n                head.next = r\n                r = r.next\n            else:\n                head.next = l\n                l = l.next\n            head = head.next\n            i += 1","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
