Rotate List </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nTo rotate a list k times to the right (clockwise), we need to move the last k elements (nodes) to the start of the list.\n\nTo do this, connect the first and last node to form a circular linked list and break the list at the kth node.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n  - if the list is empty, contains a single node, or k is 0, return because no rotation is required\n- set cur = head to traverse the list\n- set size = 1 to track list size\n- loop until the end to find the last node and list size\n  - move the cur pointer and increment size in each iteration\n- *after loop, cur will point to the last node*\n- if k is equal to the size of the list, return because the rotation will result in the same list\n- else\n    - connect the first and last nodes by setting the next node of the last node as head \n        - *(cur will point to the first node now)*\n    - loop size - k times and move cur to get (k-1)th node\n    - set head as kth node (cur.next)\n    - break the list at k by setting the next of cur (k-1th node) as null\n    - return head\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(loop to find last node and list size + loop to get k-1th node) → O(n + n - k) → O(n)\n  - *n = list size*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(total new nodes created) → O(0) → O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Definition for singly-linked list.\n# class ListNode:\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.next = next\n\n\nclass Solution:\n\n    def rotateRight(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:\n        if not head or not head.next or k == 0:\n            return head\n        cur, size = head, 1\n        while cur.next:\n            cur = cur.next\n            size += 1\n        if k == size:\n            return head\n        cur.next = head\n        for _ in range(size - k % size):\n            cur = cur.next\n        head = cur.next\n        cur.next = None\n        return head","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
