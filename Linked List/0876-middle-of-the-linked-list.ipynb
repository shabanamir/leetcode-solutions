Middle of the Linked List </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nTo find the middle, use slow-fast algorithm *(also called Tortoise and hare algorithms or Floyd's algorithm)*.\n\nUse two-pointers (slow and fast) and traverse the list. Move the slow pointer one step and the fast pointer two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer reaches the middle.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n    - if the list has only one node, the first node is the middle       \n        - return the head\n- set slow pointer = start node i.e head node and fast pointer = head node\n- loop until the last node\n    - move the slow pointer one node forward\n    - move the fast pointer two nodes forward\n- return slow as the middle node\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(loop) → O(n/2) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(total new nodes created) → O(0) → O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Definition for singly-linked list.\n# class ListNode:\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.next = next\n\n\nclass Solution:\n\n    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:\n        if not head.next:\n            return head\n        slow, fast = head, head\n        while fast and fast.next:\n            slow = slow.next\n            fast = fast.next.next\n        return slow","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
