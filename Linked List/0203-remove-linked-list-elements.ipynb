Remove Linked List Elements </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nA node can be easily deleted by removing its link with the previous node i.e updating the next pointer of the previous node to the next node.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- create a dummy node to track the new head in case the existing head is the node to be removed\n    - *(we need it because in the end we have to return the head of the list because head node is required to get all other nodes in the linked list)*\n- set cur = dummy to track current node\n    - *(this pointer is used to traverse the list and remove nodes)*\n- loop until the last node\n    - if the next node is the node to be removed\n        - update the next pointer of the current node to remove the node\n        - do not break the loop here because there can be more than one node with the same value, and we need to remove all such nodes\n    - else move forward to search for the node\n- return the dummy next node as the head \n    - *(next because dummy is a placeholder node, the actual list starts at dummy.next)*\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(loop) → O(total nodes) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(total new nodes created) → O(1) → O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Definition for singly-linked list.\n# class ListNode:\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.next = next\n\n\nclass Solution:\n\n    def removeElements(self, head: Optional[ListNode], val: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:\n        dummy = ListNode(next=head)\n        cur = dummy\n        while cur.next:\n            if cur.next.val == val:\n                cur.next = cur.next.next\n            else:\n                cur = cur.next\n        return dummy.next","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
