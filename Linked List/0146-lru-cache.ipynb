LRU Cache </center>\n","\n","\n","## Problem Description\n","[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/description/)\n","\n","\n","## Intuition\n","<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\n","In the LRU cache, we remove the least recently used cache i.e least recently inserted element if cache capacity becomes full. For this, we need a data structure that allows fast access, insertion, and deletion and has a way of identifying the order of insertion.\n","\n","- Approach 1: OrderdDict <br>\n","OrderedDict is a type of hashmap that stores the keys in the order they were inserted i.e most recently used is the bottom/last key and least recently used is the top/first key.\n","\n","- Approach 2: linked list <br>\n","Use doubly linked list to store elements in a specific order i.e most recently used near the head and least recently used near the tail of the list. Use a hashmap to map and access doubly linked list elements in O(1) time\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","\n","\n","### OrderedDict Approach\n","\n","**init()**\n","- set cache = ordered hashmap i.e ordereddict\n","- set cache capacity to the given capacity\n","\n","**get()**\n","- if the key is not in the hashmap\n","    - return -1\n","- else the key is in the hashmap\n","    - move the key to the end of the hashmap because we have accessed it and it is now the most recently used key\n","    - return the key value\n","    \n","**put()**\n","- add the key and its value to the hashmap\n","- move the key to the end of the hashmap because we have accessed it and it is now the most recently used key\n","- if there are more keys in the hashmap than the allowed capacity\n","    - remove the least recently used key i.e first/top key in the hashmap\n","\n","### Linked List Approach\n","\n","#### Class Node\n","*class to implement doubly linked list* \n","\n","**init()**\n","- set node key, value, previous and next node pointers\n","\n","#### Class LRU\n","\n","**init()**\n","- set cache capacity \n","- create a hashmap to represent cache\n","- create two nodes to represent head and tail of the list\n","- set next node of head as tail and previous node of tail as head\n","\n","**get()**\n","- if the key/element is present in the hashmap (cache hit)\n","    - get its corresponding linked list node\n","    - mark it as most recently used because we have accessed it\n","        - remove the node from the list \n","        - insert it back at the top i.e the head of the linked list.\n","    - return node value\n","- else return -1\n","\n","**put()**\n","- if the key is in the hashmap\n","    - get its corresponding node and remove it from the linked list\n","- create a new node for the key and add it to the hashmap\n","- insert the node at the head of the linked list\n","- if the hashmap size becomes greater than the cache capacity\n","    - get the last (least recently used) node from the linked list i.r previous node of the tail   \n","    - remove the node from the list and also delete it from the hashmap\n","\n","**remove()**\n","- get the previous and next node of the node to be deleted x\n","- delete the node by updating the previous and next pointers, for this do the following\n","    - make the next node of x as the next node of the previous node\n","    - make the previous node of x as the previous node of the next node\n","  \n","**insert()**\n","- set previous node pointer to the top node of the list i.e head\n","- set next node pointer to the second node of the list i.e next of the head node\n","- insert the new node, for this do the following\n","    - make the new node as the next node of the previous node\n","    - make the new node as the previous node of the next node\n","    - make the previous node as the previous node of the new node\n","    - make the next node as the next node of the new node\n","    \n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: \n","    - OrderedDict Approach\n","        - init() O(1)\n","        - get() O(1)\n","        -
