Palindrome Number </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nA number x is a palindrome if:\n- it is the same as its reverse form or\n- the left half is equal to the reversed right half\n\nApproach 1 <br>\nReverse the full number and compare the original and reversed number.\n\nApproach 2 <br>\nOnly reverse the right half of the number and compare the left half and right half. This approach will also handle the integer overflow.\n\nFor an explanation of reversing a number, check [Reverse Integer Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/solutions/3845859/o-logx-time-o-1-space-solution-explained/)\n \n \n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n**Approach 1**\n\n- check base cases\n    - if the integer x is negative or ends with a zero i.e x is not 0 but a number that ends with 0, it can't be a palindrome, return false\n- set y = x and rev = 0 to track the digits in the original and reversed part\n- loop until y is not 0 i.e there are digits left to be processed\n    - get the rightmost digit of y using %, multiply rev by 10, and add the digit \n    - divide y by 10 to remove the rightmost digit \n- compare x and reverse of x i.e rev and return the result\n\n**Approach 2**\n\n- check base cases\n    - if the integer x is negative or ends with a zero i.e x is not 0 but a number that ends with 0, it can't be a palindrome, return false\n- set left half = x and right half = 0 to track the left and reversed right half\n- loop until the left half is greater than the right half\n    - get the rightmost digit using %. to add the digit to right half, multiply the right half by 10 and add the digit \n    - divide x by 10 to remove the digit from the left half\n- after the loop, left will contain the left half, and right will contain the reverse of the right half\n- check if the left half is equal to the right half or left half is equal to the right half with one more digit removed *(this can be the case if no. of digits in x is odd, in that case, we remove the middle digit)*\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity:\n    - Approach 1 O(log$_{10}$x) → O(logx)\n    - Approach 2 O(log$_{10}$x) → O(logx)\n    - *log$_{10}$x because in each iteration x is divided by 10*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: \n    - Approach 1 O(1)\n    - Approach 2 O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:\n        \n        # approach 1\n        if x < 0 or x != 0 and x % 10 == 0:\n            return False\n        y, rev = x, 0\n        while y:\n            rev = rev * 10 + y % 10\n            y //= 10\n        return x == rev\n\n        # approach 2\n        if x < 0 or x != 0 and x % 10 == 0:\n            return False\n        left, right = x, 0\n        while left > right:\n            right = right * 10 + left % 10\n            left //= 10\n        return left == right or left == right // 10","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
