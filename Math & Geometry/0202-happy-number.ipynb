It is based on two-pointers: fast and slow. The slow pointer moves ahead one step at a time, and the fast pointer moves ahead two steps at a time. The pointers meet if there is a cycle.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- define a helper function to get the sum of squares of digits <br>\n","sum_square_digits(number)\n","    - set res = 0 to track the sum\n","    - loop until the number becomes 0\n","        - get the rightmost digit of the number using mod operator\n","        - get the square of the digits and add it to res\n","        - remove the digit from the number\n","    - return res\n","- set slow = n and fast = sum of squares of digits of n\n","- while the pointers are not equal, *the loop will break when the pointers enter a cycle i.e their values become equal*\n","    - move slow pointer 1 time\n","        - replace slow with the sum of squares of digits of slow\n","    - move fast pointer 2 times\n","        - replace fast with the sum of squares of digits of fast\n","        - replace fast with the sum of squares of digits of fast\n","- return true if fast value is 1, else false\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(loop for cycle detection * finding sum of square of digits) → O(constt * logn) → O(logn)\n","    - *the outer while loop will run a few times*\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(1)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:\n","        \n","        def sum_square_digits(n: int) -> int:\n","            res = 0\n","            while n:\n","                digit = n % 10\n","                res += digit * digit\n","                n //= 10\n","            return res\n","\n","        slow, fast = n, sum_square_digits(n)\n","        while slow != fast:\n","            slow = sum_square_digits(slow)\n","            fast = sum_square_digits(fast)\n","            fast = sum_square_digits(fast)\n","        return fast == 1"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
