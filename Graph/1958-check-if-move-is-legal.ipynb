Check if Move is Legal </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-move-is-legal/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nA move is legal if after changing the color of the cell, the cell becomes the end point of a good line. \n\nA line can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. A line is a good line if:\n- has at least 3 blocks/cells\n- has no empty cell\n- starting and ending cells are of the same color\n- starting or ending consecutive cells are not of the same color\n\nExplore all directions for the move and search for a good line.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- create a list and add all eight directions (bottom, top, right, left, bottom right, bottom left, top right, top left)\n    - *for top x is -1 because we decrement row i.e move to previous row*\n    - *for bottom x is +1 because we increment row i.e move to next row*\n    - *for top and bottom, y is 0 beacuse we move in the same col*\n    - *for left y is -1 because we decrement column i.e move to previous col*\n    - *for right y is +1 because we increment column i.e move to next col*\n    - *for left and right, x is 0 beacuse we move in the same row*\n- explore all directions to check all lines <br>\nfor each direction (x, y)\n    - set size = 2 to track cells in the current line\n    - get coordinates (row, column) of the current cell in the current line\n        - *row = input move row number + x*\n        - *col = input move column number + y*\n    - explore all cells in a line (max cells can be 8 because it is an 8 x 8 matrix)\n    while indices are inbound\n        - if the current cell is empty, the current line is not good\n            - break the while loop to check the next line\n        - if the current line size is 2, the current cell is consecutive, if it is of the same color as the move cell, the line is not good\n            - break\n        - else the current cell is not consecutive, if it is of the same color, we found a good line\n            - return true\n        - increment row and column to check the next cell in the line\n        - increment size of the line\n- if the loop completes without returning true, there's no good line, the move is illegal, return false\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(directions * cells) → O(8 * 8) → O(64) → O(1)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(directions list) → O(rows * columns) → O(8 * 2) → O(16) → O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def checkMove(self, board: List[List[str]], rMove: int, cMove: int, color: str) -> bool:\n        directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1], \n                     [1, 1], [1, -1], [-1, 1], [-1, -1]]\n        for x, y in directions:\n            size = 2\n            r = rMove + x\n            c = cMove + y\n            while 0 <= r < 8 and 0 <= c < 8:\n                if board[r][c] == '.':\n                    break\n                if size == 2 and board[r][c] == color:\n                    break\n                if board[r][c] == color:\n                    return True\n                r += x\n                c += y\n                size += 1\n        return False","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
