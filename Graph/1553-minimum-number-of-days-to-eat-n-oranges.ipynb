Minimum Number of Days to Eat N Oranges </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-eat-n-oranges/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nThe max days can be n if we eat one orange a day. \n\nWe will start with n oranges and eat oranges every day to reduce n to 0 or 1. For each day, we have two options/paths: eat n/2 oranges a day or n/3 oranges\n\nDo DFS to explore all paths and choose the best. \n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- create a hashmap for memoization i.e to store the min days required to eat x oranges\n    - *key = oranges left*\n    - *value = min days required to eat the remaining oranges*\n- add base cases to the hashmap i.e days required to eat 0 and 1 oranges\n- define a helper function for DFS <br>\ndfs(oranges left)\n    - if x is in the hashmap, we have already found the min days required to eat x oranges, return it\n    - recursively find the days required to eat x oranges if we eat x/2 oranges a day or x/3 oranges and update the hashmap with the minimum\n    - return the min days from the hashmap\n- call dfs to find min days required to eat n oranges \n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(dfs recursion) → O(calls at each level ^ total levels) → O(2$^{logn}$) → (memoization using hashmap) → O(logn)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(dfs recursion stack + hashmap) → O(total levels + n) → O(logn + n) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def minDays(self, n: int) -> int:\n        dp = {0: 0, 1: 1}\n\n        def dfs(x: int) -> int:\n            if x in dp:\n                return dp[x]\n            dp[x] = 1 + min(x % 2 + dfs(x // 2), x % 3 + dfs(x // 3))\n            return dp[x]\n\n        return dfs(n)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
