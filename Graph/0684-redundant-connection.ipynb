Redundant Connection </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/description/path-in-binary-matrix/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nAn edge has been added to a connected graph and we need to find that edge (redundant edge).\n\nAdding an edge to a connected graph creates a cycle. So, the edge that is part of a cycle is the redundant edge.\n\nWe can find the cycle in a connected graph using:\n1. DFS <br>\ntime complexity = O(n²)\n2. Union-Find <br>\ntime complexity = O(n)\n\nWe will use the optimized version of the union-find algorithm i.e union by rank and path compression.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- create a list to store parent of each node/vertex\n- create a list to store the rank (height) of each tree. Initially, each vertex represents a tree and acts as a root node of the tree, so the height is 1 for each tree\n- define a helper function to find part of the algorithm, it will find the root parent (root node) using path compression <br>\nfind(node) \n    - set p = immediate parent of the node\n    - loop until we find the root parent\n        - do path compression i.e compress the height of the trees by updating the parent\n        - update p\n    - return p\n- define a helper function for the union part. It will take two nodes and merge the lower rank node (smaller height tree) with the higher rank node <br>\nunion(node1, node2)\n    - find the root parent of the nodes\n    - if the parent of both nodes are the same, the nodes are already connected, the union can't be performed because it will result in a cycle, return false\n    - if the rank of node1 parent is greater than the rank of node2 parent, node1 belongs to a taller tree\n        - add node2 to the node1 tree by updating the root parent of node2\n        - update rank (height) of node1 parent\n    - else node2 parent rank is higher\n        - add node1 to the node2 tree by updating the root parent of node1\n        - update rank (height) of node2 parent\n- for each edge (node1, node2)\n    - check if we can add the edge i.e connect (union) the nodes. If we can't, the edge forms a cycle, return the edge \n    - else, connect the nodes\n  \n  \n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: (parent list creation + rank list creation + cycle detection using union-find) → O(E + E + E * optimized union-find) → O(E + E + E * α(n)) → O(n + n + n * constt) → O(n)\n    - *E = total edges*\n    - *α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very steadily i.e nearly constant*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(parent list + rank list) → O(V + V) → O(n + n) → O(n)\n    - *V = total vertices or nodes,  here V = E = n*\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        parent = [i for i in range(len(edges) + 1)]\n        rank = [1] * (len(edges) + 1)\n\n        def find(n: int) -> int:\n            p = parent[n]\n            while p != parent[p]:\n                parent[p] = parent[parent[p]]\n                p = parent[p]\n            return p\n\n        def union(n1: int, n2: int) -> bool:\n            p1, p2 = find(n1), find(n2)\n            if p1 == p2:\n                return False\n            if rank[p1] > rank[p2]:\n                parent[p2] = p1\n                rank[p1] += rank[p2]\n            else:\n                parent[p1] = p2\n                rank[p2] += rank[p1]\n            return True\n\n        for n1, n2 in edges:\n            if not union(n1, n2):\n                return [n1, n2]","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
