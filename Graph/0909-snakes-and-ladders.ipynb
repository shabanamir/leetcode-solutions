Snakes and Ladders </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/snakes-and-ladders/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe are given n x n grid (adjacency matrix) and we need to find the minimum moves to reach the last position i.e n². It is same as finding the shortest path in a graph, use BFS.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set n = total rows\n- set target = last position value\n- there are n² cells and n² position but the positions are arranged in reversed rows and alternating columns fashion i.e 1 (start position) is in the last row and n² (last position) is in the first row. So, reverse the board to get the rows' order correct\n- create a hash set to store the visited positions\n- create a queue for BFS. Add (root node / start position, moves required to reach root node) to queue\n- do BFS i.e loop until the queue is empty\n    - pop queue to get current position and moves required to reach it\n    - roll the dice, (a dice has 6 values, loop 6 times to get all possible next positions) <br>\n    for each dice value\n        - get the next position\n        - get the coordinates (row, column) of the next position\n            - *row = next position - 1 / total rows*\n            - *column = next position - 1 % total rows*\n        - if the row is odd, the column index = total columns - 1 - column\n            - *(in columns, the positions alternate i.e even rows have positions in ascending order and odd in descending order)*\n        - if the value at the next position is not -1 (a ladder or a snake)\n            - update the next position\n        - if the next position is the target position\n            - increment moves and return it\n        - if the next position is not visited\n            - add the position to the set\n            - add the position and moves to the queue\n- if the BFS completes without returning anything, we can't reach the last position, return -1\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(reverse + graph traversal) → O(board size + adjacency matrix BFS) → O(rows * columns + V * V) → O(n * n + rows * columns) → O(n * n + n * n) → O(n * n) → O(n²)\n    - *V = total vertices or nodes or rows or sublists*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(hashset + BFS queue) → O(total positions + V) → O(rows * columns + rows) → O(n * n + n) → O(n * n) → O(n²)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def snakesAndLadders(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        n = len(board)\n        target = n * n\n        board.reverse()\n        seen = set()\n        q = deque([(1, 0)])\n        while q:\n            square, moves = q.popleft()\n            for i in range(1, 7):\n                next_sq = square + i\n                r, c = (next_sq - 1) // n, (next_sq - 1) % n\n                if r % 2:\n                    c = n - 1 - c\n                if board[r][c] != -1:\n                    next_sq = board[r][c]\n                if next_sq == target:\n                    return moves + 1\n                if next_sq not in seen:\n                    seen.add(next_sq)\n                    q.append((next_sq, moves + 1))\n        return -1","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
