It is the same as finding the shortest path in a graph, use BFS. Start BFS from the root node (0000) to check the nodes level by level.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n    - if the target is the start node (combination), we unlocked the lock without turning the wheel, return 0\n    - convert the deadends to a set to search in O(1) time\n    - if the start node is in the deadends, we can't unlock it, return -1\n- set seen = a set to store the visited nodes and add the start node\n- create a queue for BFS and add the start node\n- set res = 0 to track the total turns\n- traverse the graph level by level i.e loop until the queue is empty\n    - for current level\n        - pop queue to get current node\n        - if node is the target node, return res\n        - create the child nodes <br>\n        for each of the 4 wheels\n            - get current wheel digit i.e char at index i in the current node\n            - turn it up and get the child node i.e increment the digit at index i to get a combination\n            - if the child node is not in visited and not in deadends, add it to the queue and set\n            - turn it down and get the child node i.e decrement the digit at index i to get a combination\n            - if the child node is not in visited and not in deadends, add it to the queue and set\n    - increment res after checking a level\n- if the BFS completes without returning anything, there's no shortest path i.e we can't unlock it, return -1\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(graph BFS) → O(V) → O(total nodes/combinations) → O(10$^4$)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(BFS queue + hashset) → O(x + total nodes) → O(x + 10$^4$)\n    - *at each level, at most 8 (2$^4$) child nodes are created for a node*\n    - *the nodes at last level = 8$^{last level}$ = some constant less than 10$^4$ = x*\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def openLock(self, deadends: List[str], target: str) -> int:\n        if target == '0000':\n            return 0\n        deadends = set(deadends)\n        if '0000' in deadends:\n            return -1\n        seen = set('0000')\n        q = deque(['0000'])\n        res = 0\n        while q:\n            for _ in range(len(q)):\n                cur = q.popleft()\n                if cur == target:\n                    return res\n                for i in range(4):\n                    digit = int(cur[i])\n                    up = cur[:i] + str((digit + 1) % 10) + cur[i+1:]\n                    if up not in seen and up not in deadends:\n                        q.append(up)\n                        seen.add(up)\n                    down = cur[:i] + str((digit - 1) % 10) + cur[i+1:]\n                    if down not in seen and down not in deadends:\n                        q.append(down)\n                        seen.add(down)\n            res += 1\n        return -1","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
