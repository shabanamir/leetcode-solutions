Find Eventual Safe States </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nA node is safe if it is not part of a cycle.\n\nDo DFS and check for cycles. Add all cycle-free nodes to the result.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- create a hashmap to track the status of a node\n    - *key = node*\n    - *value = status (0 = unvisited, -1 = visiting i.e on the current path, 1 = visited)*\n- define a helper function for DFS <br>\ndfs(cuurent node/course)\n    - if status is -1, we encounter the current node again in the path, there is a cycle\n        - return false\n    - if status is 1, current node is visited and is cycle-free\n        - return True\n    - else it is an unvisited node\n        - add it to the current path by updating the status to -1\n        - visit all its neighbors\n            - if a neighbor is part of a cycle\n                - return false\n        - mark the current node as visited and cycle-free by updating the status to 1\n        - return true\n- for each node\n    - do DFS to check if the node is safe, if it is safe\n        - add it to the result list\n- return the result list\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(graph traversal) → O(adjacency list DFS) → O(V + E)\n    - *V = total vertices or nodes or rows or sublists or keys*\n    - *E = total edges*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(DFS stack + result list) → O(V + V) → O(V)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def eventualSafeNodes(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        state = defaultdict(int)\n\n        def dfs(node: int) -> bool:\n            if state[node] == -1:\n                return False\n            if state[node] == 1:\n                return True\n            state[node] = -1\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if not dfs(neighbor):\n                    return False\n            state[node] = 1\n            return True\n\n        return [node for node in range(len(graph)) if dfs(node)]","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
