Pacific Atlantic Water Flow </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe need to find the cell from which water can flow to pacific and atlantic oceans. The water can flow from a cell to an adjacent cell or the ocean if the height of the adjacent cell is less than or equal. \n\nThe grid is an adjacency matrix (graph), and we need to find the path with non-increasing values. Use DFS to traverse the graph and check the cells. If we can reach the pacific ocean (top and left border) and atlantic ocean (bottom and left border) from a cell, add that cell to result.\n\nInstead of doing DFS for each cell, only do DFS for the first row, last row, first column, and last column cells. Because the first row and first column are adjacent to the pacific, and the last row and last column are adjacent to the atlantic.\n\n- For first row and column cells, do dfs to find cells that can reach pacific and add it to pacific ocean set\n- For last row and column cells, do dfs to find cells that can reach atlantic and add it to atalntic oceean set\n- reutrn intersection of the two sets\n\nNote: As we are going in reverse, the condition for overflow (adjacent cell height <=) will be reverserd (adjacent cell height >=)\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set m = total rows\n- set n = total columns\n- create two hashsets, pacific and atlantic, to add the cells that can reach the respective oceans. Add the cell coordinates i.e (row index, column index)\n- define a helper function for DFS <br>\ndfs(row, column, visited cells, previous cell height)\n    - if the indices are not inbound or current cell has been visited or current cell height is less than previous height, the current cell can't reach the ocean\n        - return\n    - else it can reach the ocean (atlantic or pacific depending on which set was passed with the call), add the coordinates to the respective set\n    - traverse the adjacent cells (top, bottom, left, right)\n- traverse all cells in the first row and last row to find cells that satisfy the overflow condition\n    - *first row index is 0, last row index is m - 1*\n    - for first-row cells (pacific cells), do dfs to find cells that can reach the pacific and add the cells to pacific set\n    - for last-row cells (atlantic cells), find cells that can reach the atlantic\n- traverse the first and last column cells and do the same as above\n    - *first col index is 0, last col index is n - 1*\n- find the cells that can reach both pacific and atlantic i.e intersection of pacific and atlantic sets and return the result as a list  \n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(graph traversal + intersection) → O(adjacency matrix DFS + min(set1, set2)) → O(V * V + m * n) → O(rows * columns + m * n) → O(m * n + m * n) → O(m * n)\n    - *V = total vertices or nodes or rows or sublists*\n    - *if all cell's height is the same, water will flow from each cell, and hashset will contain all cells (m * n)*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(DFS recursion stack + atlantic hashset + pacific hashset + result list) → O(V + m * n + m * n + m * n) → O(m + m * n + m * n + m * n) → O(m * n)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def pacificAtlantic(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        m, n = len(heights), len(heights[0])\n        pacific, atlantic = set(), set()\n\n        def dfs(r, c, visit, prev_h):\n            if r < 0 or c < 0 or r == m or c == n or  (r, c) in visit or heights[r][c] < prev_h:\n                return\n            visit.add((r, c))\n            dfs(r + 1, c, visit, heights[r][c])\n            dfs(r - 1, c, visit, heights[r][c])\n            dfs(r, c + 1, visit, heights[r][c])\n            dfs(r, c - 1, visit, heights[r][c])\n\n        for c in range(n):\n            dfs(0, c, pacific, heights[0][c])\n            dfs(m - 1, c, atlantic, heights[m - 1][c])\n        for r in range(m):\n            dfs(r, 0, pacific, heights[r][0])\n            dfs(r, n - 1, atlantic, heights[r][n - 1])\n        # return [(r, c) for r in range(m) for c in range(n) if (r, c) in pacific and (r, c) in atlantic]\n        return list(pacific.intersection(atlantic))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
