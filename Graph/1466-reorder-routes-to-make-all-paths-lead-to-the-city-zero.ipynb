We need to reorient roads that don't lead to capital (city 0) .\n","\n","Visit all cities from city 0 and count the roads that need to be oriented. \n","\n","To do this, create an undirected graph and do DFS. Start from the root vertex (city 0), if we get a forward edge (one-way road from city 0 to another city), we need to reverse (reorient) it. Count the total forward edges.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- use a hashmap to create an undirected graph (adjacency list)\n","    - *key = vertex or node i.e city*\n","    - *value = list of neighbors*\n","    - *we can also use a nested list*\n","- create a stack for DFS and add the root node \n","- create a set to store visited nodes\n","- set res = 0 to count the forward edges (roads that need to be reoriented)\n","- for each edge (start city, end city) in the connection list\n","    - add bidirectional edge to the graph i.e add the end city as a neighbor to the neighbors list of the start city and vice versa\n","    - also add an indicator with each neighbor to indicate that the edge is forward or backward\n","    - in the input list the edges are forward (from start city to end city), so use 1 for forward and 0 for backward\n","- do DFS i.e loop until the stack is empty\n","    - pop stack to get current node\n","    - add the current node to the visited set\n","    - for each neighbor and edge indicator in the neighbor's list of the current node\n","        - if we haven't visited the node\n","            - if the edge is a forward edge i.e value is 1\n","                - increment res\n","            - add the node to the stack\n","- return res\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(graph creation + graph traversal) → O(adjacency list creation + adjacency list DFS) → O(E + V + E) → O(V + E) → O(n + n) → O(n)\n","    - *V = total vertices or nodes or rows or sublists or keys = roads*\n","    - *E = total edges = connections*\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(graph + DFS stack) → O(adjacency list + V) → O(V + E + V) → O(V + E) → O(n + n) → O(n)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n","        graph = defaultdict(list)\n","        stack = [0]\n","        seen = set()\n","        res = 0\n","        for a, b in connections:\n","            graph[a].append((b, 1))\n","            graph[b].append((a, 0))\n","        while stack:\n","            node = stack.pop()\n","            seen.add(node)\n","            for neighbor, edge_type in graph[node]:\n","                if neighbor not in seen:\n","                    stack.append(neighbor)\n","                    if edge_type == 1: \n","                        res += 1\n","        return res"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
