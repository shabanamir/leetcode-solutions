Minimum Fuel Cost to Report to the Capital </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-fuel-cost-to-report-to-the-capital/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nTotal fuel = sum of cars required at each child node to reach the parent node\n\nTotal cars required at a node = ceil (passengers arriving at the node / total seats in the car)\n\nceil is used to round up the number <br>\nFor example:  <br>\npassenger = 1, seats = 2 <br>\ncars required = passengers/seats = 1/2 = 0.5 = ceil(0.5) = 1 <br>\n\nDo DFS to traverse all nodes, find the child nodes and the cars required.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set res = 0 to track the total fuel\n- create a hashmap for the adjacency list representation of the graph\n    - *key = node*\n    - *value = list of neighbor nodes*\n- create the graph (adjacency list)\n    - for each edge (source node, destination node)\n        - add a bidirectional edge from the source to the destination i.e add destination node to the neighbors list of the source node and vice versa\n- define a helper function for DFS <br>\ndfs(current node, parent node)\n  - mark res as nonlocal\n      - *(this is to access outer function variables in nested functions)*\n  - set total = 1 to track the total passengers arriving at the current node\n      - *(1 because initially there is one passenger at each node)*\n  - for each neighbor (child node) of the current node\n    - if the neighbor is not the parent i.e it is a child node, *(this is to make sure we are not moving backward)*\n      - do DFS to find the passengers arriving at the child node\n      - add the child node passengers to the total passengers\n      - find the total cars required for the child node passengers and update res\n  - return total\n- start DFS from the root node\n- return res\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity:  O(graph creation + graph traversal) → O(adjacency list creation + adjacency list DFS) → O(E + V + E) → O(V + E) → O(n + n) → O(n + n)\n    - *V = total vertices or nodes or rows or sublists or keys = cities*\n    - *E = total edges = roads*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(graph + DFS recursion stack) → O(adjacency list + V) → O(V + E + V) → O(V + E) → O(n + n) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n    \n    def minimumFuelCost(self, roads: List[List[int]], seats: int) -> int:\n        res = 0\n        graph = defaultdict(list)\n        for u, v in roads:\n            graph[u].append(v)\n            graph[v].append(u)\n        \n        def dfs(node: int, parent: int) -> None:\n            nonlocal res\n            total = 1\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if neighbor != parent:\n                    cur = dfs(neighbor, node)\n                    total += cur\n                    res += ceil(cur / seats)\n            return total\n\n        dfs(0, None)\n        return res","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
