For example, if node 0 has neighbors 2 and 3 then node 0 should be in a separate set and nodes 2, 3 in a separate one.\n","\n","Do BFS to check if the neighbors can be placed in separate sets.\n","\n","Instead of using two sets to put the nodes, mark/color the nodes. <br>\n","color white (0) → not placed in a set <br>\n","color blue (1) → set A (nodes set) <br>\n","color red (-1) → set B (neighbors set)\n","\n","\n","# Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- set n = total number of nodes\n","- initialize an array of size n with zeroes to color the nodes\n","    - *index = node*\n","    - *value = color*\n","- define a helper function for BFS <br>\n","bfs(node)\n","    - if the node has been colored (value = 1 or -1), it has been visited and placed in a set, return True\n","    - create a queue and add the node\n","    - color the node\n","    - while q is not empty\n","        - pop a node from the q to get current level node\n","        - visit the neighbors of the currrent node\n","            - if the neighbor is colored and the color is same as the current node, the neighbor node will be placed in the same set, return false\n","            - if the neighbor is not colored\n","                - add it to the queue\n","                - color the neighbor with the opposite color of the current node\n","- for each node in the graph\n","    - if the node is not colored (not placed in a set), do BFS to check if we can place the node and its neighbors in separate sets.
