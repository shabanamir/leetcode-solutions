Accounts Merge </center>\n","\n","\n","## Problem Description\n","[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/accounts-merge/description/)\n","\n","\n","## Intuition\n","<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\n","We need to merge the same accounts. Accounts are same if there is a common email address. \n","In other words, same nodes (accounts) are connected by a common edge (email address) and form a subgraph (connected component). We need to find the connected components. This can be done using:\n","1. DFS\n","2. Union-Find\n","\n","Unio-Find is fast, we will use the optimized version of the union-find algorithm i.e union by rank and path compression.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","#### **Union-Find Class**\n","*define a class to implement union-find. There is no need to create a separate class, we can also implement it using nested functions but it's better this way*\n","\n","**init(total nodes)**\n","- create a list to store parent of each node/vertex\n","- create a list to store the rank (height) of each tree. Initially, each node represents a tree and acts as a root node of the tree, so the height is 1 for each tree\n","\n","**find(node)** <br>\n","*it will find the root parent (root node) using path compression*\n","- loop until we find the root parent\n","- do path compression i.e compress the height of the trees by   updating the parent\n","- update the node\n","- return parent of the node \n","\n","**union (node1, node2)** <br>\n","*it will take two nodes and merge the lower rank node (smaller tree) with the higher rank node*\n","- find the root parent of the nodes\n","- if their parents are not the same, we can merge the nodes\n","    - find the max and min of the parents i.e higher rank and lower rank tree\n","    - add the lower rank node to the higher rank node by updating the parent of the lower rank node and rank of the higher rank node\n","\n","#### **Merge Accounts Function**\n","- create a union-find class objective. Pass the total number of accounts to create parent and rank lists\n","- set email_acc = a hashmap to map each email to the corresponding account index\n","    - *key = email*\n","    - *value = account index*\n","- set acc_emails = hashmap to map each account index to the list of corresponding emails \n","    - *key = account index*\n","    - *value = list of emails*\n","- iterate over each account and its emails to merge accounts <br>\n","for each account index, (account name, list of emails) in the accounts list\n","    - for each email\n","        - if the email is already in the email_acc hashmap, merge the current account and the account that contains the same email\n","        - else add the email and current account index to the email_acc hashmap\n","- iterate over each email and account index in the email_acc hashmap to find the root account and its emails <br>\n","for each email and account index in the email_acc hashmap\n","    - find the root account and add the email to the list of emails of the root account in acc_emails hashmap\n","- iterate over each account index and its emails in the acc_emails hashmap to prepare the result list <br>\n","for each account index and its list of emails in the acc_emails \n","    - create a sub-list containing the account name and its emails in sorted order and add it to the result list \n","- return result list\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: (accounts traversal for merging + hashmap traversal for finding root account + result list creation) → O(accounts * account emails * union-find + unique emails * find + accounts * sorting emails) → O(n * k * α(n) + m * α(n) + n * klogk) → O(n * k * constt + m * constt + n * klogk) → O(nk + m + n * klogk) → O(n * klogk)\n","    - *n = total number of accounts*\n","    - *m = total number of unique emails*\n","    - *k = emails belonging to a single account*\n","    - *α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very steadily i.e nearly constant*\n","    - *the result is a nested list, each sublist contains an account name and its emails*\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(parent list + rank list + email_acc hashmap + acc_emails hashmap + result list) → O(n + n + unique emails + accounts + accounts * account emails) → O(n + n + m + n + n * k) → O(n * k)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["class UnionFind:\n","\n","    def __init__(self, n):\n","        self.parent = [i for i in range(n)]\n","        self.rank = [1] * n\n","    \n","    def find(self, x):\n","        while x != self.parent[x]:\n","            self.parent[x] = self.parent[self.parent[x]]\n","            x = self.parent[x]\n","        return self.parent[x]\n","    \n","    def union(self, x1, x2):\n","        p1, p2 = self.find(x1), self.find(x2)\n","        if p1 != p2:\n","            maxi = max(p1, p2)\n","            mini = min(p1, p2)\n","            self.parent[mini] = maxi\n","            self.rank[maxi] = mini\n","\n","\n","class Solution:\n","\n","    def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:\n","        uf = UnionFind(len(accounts))\n","        email_acc = {}\n","        acc_emails = defaultdict(list)\n","        for i, (_, *emails) in enumerate(accounts):\n","            for e in emails:\n","                if e in email_acc:\n","                    uf.union(i, email_acc[e])\n","                else:\n","                    email_acc[e] = i\n","        for e, a in email_acc.items():\n","            acc_emails[uf.find(a)].append(e)\n","        return [[accounts[a][0]] + sorted(emails) for a, emails in acc_emails.items()]"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
