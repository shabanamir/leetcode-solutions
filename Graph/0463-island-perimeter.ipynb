Island Perimeter </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe are given m x n binary matrix. 1 represents land cell and 0 represents water cell. Each cell is a square and the land cells form the island. We need to find the island perimeter.\n\nPerimeter of a cell = total sides = 4 <br>\nbut here we will only count those sides that are adjacent to water <br>\nPerimeter of island = total sides adjacent to water\n\nTraverse each cell, if you get a land cell:\n- Approach 1 <br>\n    Check all 4 sides/neighbors (top, bottom, left, right). If the neighbor is a water cell, increment the perimeter count.\n- Approach 2 (fast) <br>\n    Increment the perimeter count by 4 and check only two sides/neighbors i.e. either top & left or bottom & right. If any of the neighbors is a land cell, decrement the count by 2 .\n  \n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set m = total rows\n- set n = total columns\n- set res = 0 to track the perimeter\n- for each cell\n    - if it is a land cell\n        - increment res by 4\n        - if row index is inbound and the bottom cell is a land cell, decrement res by 2\n        - if column index is inbound and the right cell is a land cell, decrement res by 2\n- return res\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(grid traversal) → O(rows * columns) → O(m * n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n\n        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n        res = 0\n        for r in range(m):\n            for c in range(n):\n                if grid[r][c] == 1:\n                    res += 4\n                    if r + 1 < m and grid[r + 1][c] == 1:\n                        res -= 2\n                    if c + 1 < n and grid[r][c + 1] == 1:\n                        res -= 2\n        return res","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
