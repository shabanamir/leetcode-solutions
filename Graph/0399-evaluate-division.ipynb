Evaluate Division </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nSolve it using a graph.\n\nRepresent the equations as a directed weighted graph. Use the numerators and denominators as nodes and the value as the edge weight. For each equation, add forward and backward edges. For example, for equation a/b = x, we will add a forward edge from node a to b with weight x and a backward edge from node b to a with weight 1/x.\n\nTreat the query as finding path in a graph. For each query (a/b), we will find a path from node a to b using BFS and return the path value i.e product of the weights of the edges.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- create a hashmap to represent an adjacency list (graph)\n    - *key = node*\n    - *value = list of neighbor nodes, each neighbor will be a pair representing the neighbor node and edge weight*\n- pair the equations and values lists and traverse them to create a graph <br>\nfor each source node, destination node, value in the paired list of equations and values\n    - add a forward edge\n    - add a backward edge\n- define a helper function for BFS <br>\nbfs(source node, destination node)\n    - create a q for BFS. Each value in the queue will represent a node and the value of the path to reach that node\n    - add source node and its path value to the queue\n    - create a hashset to mark the visited nodes\n    - add source node to the hashset\n    - do BFS\n    loop until q is empty\n        - pop q to get current node and current path value\n        - if current node is the destination node, we found a path, return the path value\n        - else visit neighbors of the current node <br>\n        for each neighbor node, edge weight in the neighbors list \n            - if the neighbor is not visited\n                - add the node and its path value to the q \n                - mark the neighbor as visited\n    - if BFS completes without retuning a path, there is no path between the source and destination nodes, return -1\n- traverse queries <br>\nfor each source node (numerator), destination node (denominator) in the queries list\n    - if both nodes are in the graph, do BFS to find a path and add the path value to the result list\n    - else add -1 to the result list\n- return result list\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(graph creation + result) → O(adjacency list creation + queries * bfs) → O(E + Q * (V + E)) → O(Q * (V + E))\n    - *Q = total queries*\n    - *V = total vertices or nodes = unique numerators and denominators = lowercase English letters = 26*\n    - *E = total edges = total equations*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(graph + seen hashset + bfs queue + result list) → O(adjacency list + total nodes + deepest level nodes + total queries) → O(V + E + V + V + Q) → O(V + E + Q)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def calcEquation(self, equations: List[List[str]], values: List[float], queries: List[List[str]]) -> List[float]:\n        graph = defaultdict(list)\n        for (u, v), value in zip(equations, values):\n            graph[u].append((v, value))\n            graph[v].append((u,  1 / value))\n\n        def bfs(src: str, dst: str) -> float:\n            q = deque([(src, 1)])\n            seen = set()\n            seen.add(src)\n            while q:\n                node, path_val = q.popleft()\n                if node == dst:\n                    return path_val\n                for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:\n                    if neighbor not in seen:\n                        q.append((neighbor, weight * path_val))\n                        seen.add(neighbor)\n            return -1\n            \n        return [bfs(src, dst) if src in graph and dst in graph else -1 for src, dst in queries]","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
