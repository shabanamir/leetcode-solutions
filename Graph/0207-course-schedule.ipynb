Course Schedule </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nIt is the same as finding a cycle in a graph. We can finish all courses if there is topological order (no cycle) and vice versa.\n\nCreate a graph with courses as vertices/nodes and prerequisites as edges. Do DFS to check for cycle.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- create a hashmap for the graph (adjacency list)\n    - *key = nodes*\n    - *value = list of neighbor nodes*\n    - *we can also use a nested list*\n- create a hashmap to track the status of a node\n    - *key = node*\n    - *value = status (0 = unvisited, -1 = visiting i.e on the current path, 1 = visited)*\n- fill the hashmap to create graph\n    - for each edge (course, prerequisite) in the prerequisites list\n        - add the prerequisite as a neighbor node to the course node\n- define a helper function for DFS <br>\ndfs(cuurent node/course)\n    - if status is -1, we encountered the current node again in the path, there is a cycle\n        - return false\n    - if status is 1, current node is visited and is cycle free i.e we have taken all the prerequisites for this course\n        - return True\n    - else it is an unvisited node\n        - add it to the current path by updating the status to -1\n        - visit all the neighbors to check for cycle\n            - if there is a cycle and we can't finish the course i.e dfs returns false\n                - return false\n        - if the neighbors loop executes without returning false, the current node is cycle-free and we can finish this course\n            - remove it from the current path by updating the status to 1\n            - return true\n- for each course\n    - do DFS to check if we can finish this course, if we can not i.e dfs returns false\n        - return false\n- if the loop executes without returning false, we can finish all courses, return true\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(graph creation + graph traversal) → O(adjacency list creation + adjacency list DFS) → O(E + V + E) → O(V + E)\n    - *V = total vertices or nodes or rows or sublists or keys = courses*\n    - *E = total edges = prerequisites*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(hashmap to represent graph + DFS stack + hashset) → O(adjacency list + V + V) → O(V + E + V + V) → O(V + E)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n        graph = defaultdict(list)\n        state = defaultdict(int)\n        for a, b in prerequisites:\n            graph[a].append(b)\n\n        def dfs(node: int) -> bool:\n            if state[node] == -1:\n                return False\n            if state[node] == 1:\n                return True\n            state[node] = -1\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if not dfs(neighbor):\n                    return False\n            state[node] = 1\n            return True\n\n        for course in range(numCourses):\n            if not dfs(course):\n                return False\n        return True","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
