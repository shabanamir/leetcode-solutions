We need to find a path starting from the root node that includes all apple nodes and has minimum edges.\n","\n","The time here means no. of edges because passing 1 edge requires 1 second. \n","\n","Do DFS to visit every node and check if it has an apple. If a node has an apple, count the number of edges (nodes) to reach that node from the root node. Double the number of edges to include the comeback time.\n","\n","1 second to pass an edge + 1 second to come back\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- create a hashmap to represent the graph (adjacency list)\n","    - *key = node*\n","    - *value = list of neighbor nodes*\n","    - *(we can also use a 2D array for the adjacency list)*\n","- traverse the edges list and fill the graph\n","  - for each edge between nodes a and b\n","    - add forward edge i.e add node b to the neighbor list of node a\n","    - add backward edge i.e node a to the neighbor list of node b\n","- define a helper function to do DFS <br>\n","dfs(current node, parent node)\n","    - set time = 0 to track the time required to visit a node with an apple and come back to the current node\n","    - traverse the neighbor nodes of the current node\n","      - if the neighbor is a child node\n","        - *(we only count the child node time because we have already visited the parent node)*\n","        - recursively check for apples and update time\n","    - if the current node has an apple and is not the root node (i.e 0)\n","        - add 2 to time \n","            - *(2 = 1 second to pass an edge + 1 second to come back)*\n","    - return time\n","- start dfs from the root node and return the result\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(graph creation + graph DFS) → O(adjacency list creation + adjacency list DFS) → O(E + V + E) → O(V + E) \n","  - *V = total vertices or nodes or hashmap keys = n*\n","  - *E = total edges*\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(graph/hashmap + recursion stack) → O(V + V) → O(V)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def minTime(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], hasApple: List[bool]) -> int:\n","        adj = defaultdict(list)\n","        for a, b in edges:\n","            adj[a].append(b)\n","            adj[b].append(a)\n","\n","        def dfs(node, parent):\n","            time = 0\n","            for neighbor in adj[node]:\n","                if neighbor != parent:\n","                    time += dfs(neighbor, node)\n","            if (time or hasApple[node]) and node != 0:\n","                time += 2\n","            return time\n","            \n","        return dfs(0, None)"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
