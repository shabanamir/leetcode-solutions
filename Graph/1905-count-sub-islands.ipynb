Count Sub Islands </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-sub-islands/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe are given two m x n binary grids and need to return the number of sub-islands in grid2.\n\nThe grid is an adjacency matrix (graph). We need to find the subgraphs (islands) and check if it is valid i.e a sub-island.\n\nDo parallel DFS. Traverse the second graph (grid2) and search for subgraphs (islands). When you get a subgraph (an unvisited land cell represents the start vertex of a subgraph), check if the corresponding cell in the first graph (grid1) is also a land cell. If it is, we get a sub-island.\n\nFor marking a vertex/cell as visited, use a hash set or replace its value with 2 (you can use any number or character except 1).\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set m = total rows and n = total columns\n- define a helper function for DFS <br>\ndfs(row, column)\n    - if the indices are out of bounds or current cell value in grid2 is not 1 i.e either it is a visited land cell (value 2) or a water cell (value 0), we get a sub-island\n        - return 1\n    - else cell is an unvisited land cell (start cell of an island (subgraph)) \n        - mark it as a visited\n        - visit its 4 neighbors (left, right, top, bottom) using DFS to find other cells on the island and check the corresponding cell in grid1 to know if the island is a sub-island. Return the result (1 if it is a sub-island, 0 if it is not)\n- set res = 0 to count the sub-islands\n- for each cell in grid2\n    - if it is an unvisited land cell i.e value is 1, we found an island (subgraph)\n        - do dfs to find other cells on the island and check if it is a sub-island and add the result to res\n- return res\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(graph traversal) → O(adjacency matrix DFS) → O(V * V) → O(rows * columns) → O(m * n)\n    - *V = total vertices or nodes or rows or sublists or keys*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(DFS recursion stack) → O(V) → O(rows) → O(m)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def countSubIslands(self, grid1: List[List[int]], grid2: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        m, n = len(grid2), len(grid2[0])\n\n        def dfs(r: int, c: int) -> int:\n            if r < 0 or c < 0 or r == m or c == n or grid2[r][c] != 1:\n                return 1\n            grid2[r][c] = 2\n            return dfs(r + 1, c) & dfs(r - 1, c) & dfs(r, c - 1) & dfs(r, c + 1) & grid1[r][c]\n\n        res = 0\n        for r in range(m):\n            for c in range(n):\n                if grid2[r][c] == 1:\n                    res += dfs(r, c)\n        return res","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
