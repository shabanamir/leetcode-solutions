Largest Color Value in a Directed Graph </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-color-value-in-a-directed-graph/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nDo topological sorting to detect cycles and compute the color value of each node's path. \n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set res = 0 to track the max color value \n- set seen = 0 to track the total visited nodes\n- set n = total number of nodes\n- create a hashmap to represent the graph (adjacency list)\n    - *key = node*\n    - *value = list of neighbor nodes*\n- create a queue for BFS for topological sorting\n- create a list of size n to store the in-degree (total number of incoming edges) of each node\n    - *index = node*\n    - *value = in-degree*\n- create a list to store the frequency of each color for each node's path\n    - *index = node*\n    - *value = hashmap of color values*\n        - *hashmap key = color*\n        - *value = frequency of the color*\n- add edges to the graph\n    - for each source node, destination node in the edges\n        - add an edge from destination node to source node\n        - increment the in-degree of the destination node\n- add nodes with 0-indegree to the queue\n- do topological sort\n    - loop until q is empty\n        - pop q to get a node to process\n        - get the color of the node and increment the count of that color\n        - update res\n        - we have visited a new node, increment seen\n        - visit the neighbors of the current node, update the colors, and reduce the neighbor in-degree by 1. Add neighbor to q if in-degree becomes 0\n- if we have not visited all n nodes, there is a cycle, return -1\n- else return res\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(graph (adjacency list) creation + nodes traversal to add nodes with 0 in-degree to queue + BFS) → O(E + V + V + E) → O(V + E) → O(n + m)\n    - *V = total vertices or nodes*\n    - *E = total edges*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(graph (adjacency list) + in-degree list + count list + BFS queue) → O(V + E + V + V + V) → O(V + E) → O(n + m)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def largestPathValue(self, colors: str, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        res, seen, n = 0, 0, len(colors)\n        graph, q = defaultdict(list), deque()\n        in_degree = [0] * n\n        count = [defaultdict(int) for _ in range(n)]\n        for u, v in edges:\n            graph[v].append(u)\n            in_degree[u] += 1\n        for node in range(n):\n            if not in_degree[node]:\n                q.append(node)\n        while q:\n            cur = q.popleft()\n            count[cur][colors[cur]] += 1\n            res = max(res, count[cur][colors[cur]])\n            seen += 1\n            for v in graph[cur]:\n                for c in count[cur]:\n                    count[v][c] = max(count[v][c], count[cur][c])\n                in_degree[v] -= 1\n                if not in_degree[v]:\n                    q.append(v)\n        if seen < n:\n            return -1\n        return res","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
