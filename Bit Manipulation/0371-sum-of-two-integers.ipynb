Sum of Two Integers </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nTo add two numbers, we start from the right side and add digits. If the result is a two-digit number, we keep the rightmost digit and pass the leftmost as carry to the next digit.\n\nTo add numbers without the + operator, use bit manipulation. Add bits using XOR, get carry using AND, and pass the carry using LEFT SHIFT operator. <br> \na + b = a XOR b + ((a AND b) << 1) \n\nXOR is used to get the rightmost bit of the result because it returns 1 if bits are different and 0 if bits are the same. \n\nAND is used to get carry because it returns 1 if both bits are 1 else 0. In binary addition, you only get a carry if both bits are 1.\n\n0 + 0 = 0     rightmost bit 0 carry 0 <br> \n1 + 1 = 10    rightmost bit 0 carry 1 <br> \n0 + 1 = 1     rightmost bit 1 carry 0 <br> \n1 + 0 = 1     rightmost bit 1 carry 0 \n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n    - if any of the two numbers is 0, return the other number because \nx + 0 = x\n- initialize a mask variable\n    - *0xffffffff is a 32-bit mask in hexadecimal and is equal to 2147483647 in decimal. You can use the binary representation also*\n    - *Python's default-int size is not 32-bit, it is a large number. So to prevent overflow and stop running into an infinite loop, we need to use a 32-bit mask to limit int size to 32-bit (0xffffffff)*\n- while there is carry and the result is in the range of 32-bit\n    - get carry using AND\n    - add a and b using XOR and store the rightmost bit in a\n    - pass carry to the next bit using LEFT SHIFT and store it in b\n- check for overflow and return a\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: (loop) → O(32) → O(1)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:\n        if a == 0:\n            return b\n        if b == 0:\n            return a\n        mask = 0xffffffff \n        while b & mask:\n            carry = a & b \n            a = a ^ b\n            b = carry << 1\n        return (a & mask) if b > 0 else a","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
