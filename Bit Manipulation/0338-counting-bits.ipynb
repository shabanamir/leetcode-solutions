Counting Bits </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe need to find the numbers in the range 0 to n and return the number of set bits (1's) in their binary form. \n\nOne way is to generate the binary form of each number and count the set bits → O(n) time\n\nTo do this in constant time, use the formula <br>\nset bits in a number x = set bits in x/2 + (1 if x is odd else 0) <br>\n*(we add 1 if x is odd because the rightmost bit (LSB) is set in odd numbers. Dividing a number by 2 shifts the bits towards right and in this process, the rightmost bit is lost.)*\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- initialize an array of size n + 1 with zeroes to count set bits for each number in range 0 to n\n    - *index = number, value = total set bits*\n- start the loop from 1 because number of set bits in 0 is 0\n- for each number in the range 1 to n\n    - find the number of set bits using the formula and add it to res\n        - *set bits in num = (set bits in num / 2) + LSB*\n            - *num & 1 will be zero if the number is even because 0 & 1 = 0 and will be 1 if the number is odd because 1 & 1 = 1*\n            - *you can also use the mod operator to check for even and odd*\n            - *another way to get num/2 is using right shift i.e num >> 1*\n- return res\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(creating result array + array traversal) → O(n + n) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(result array) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:\n        res = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            res[i] = res[i // 2] + (i & 1)\n        return res","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
