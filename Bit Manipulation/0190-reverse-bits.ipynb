Reverse Bits </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nIt is the same as [Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/description/), but here we have to reverse bits instead of digits. \n\nTo reverse bits in a number x, each time get a bit from the right side of x, add it to the result, and remove the bit from x.\n\nUse AND operator to get a bit from the right side, LEFT SHIFT operator to add a bit, and RIGHT SHIFT operator to remove a bit from the right side.\n\nSteps to reverse 1101 to 1011\n- n = 1101, res = 0000\n    - get the rightmost bit of n \n    1011 & 1 = 1, so the rightmost bit is 1\n        *(you can also do even-odd check using mod operator to get the rightmost bit because rightmost bit is 1 in odd numbers and 0 in even numbers)*\n    - shift bits of res to left to make space to add the bit <br>\n    0000 << 1 = 0000\n    - add the rightmost bit to res <br>\n    0000 + 1 = 0001\n    - shift bits of n to right to remove the rightmost bit <br>\n    1101 >> 1 = 0110\n    - n = 0110 and res = 0001\n- n = 0110, res = 0001 \n    - rightmost bit of n = 0110 & 1 = 0\n    - left shift res = 0001 << 1 = 0010\n    - adding rightmost bit to res = 0010 + 0 = 0010\n    - right shift n = 0110 >> 1 = 0011\n    - n = 0011, res = 0010\n- n = 0011, res = 0010 \n    - rightmost bit of n = 0011 & 1 = 1\n    - left shift res = 0010 << 1 = 0100\n    - adding rightmost bit to res = 0100 + 1 = 0101\n    - right shift n = 0011 >> 1 = 0001\n    - n = 0001, res = 0101\n- n = 0001, res = 0101 \n    - rightmost bit of n = 0001 & 1 = 1\n    - left shift res = 0101 << 1 = 1010\n    - adding rightmost bit to res = 1010 + 1 = 1011\n    - right shift n = 0001 >> 1 = 0000\n    - n = 0000, res = 1011\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set res = 0 to store the result i.e reverse binary form of n\n- loop 32 times because n is a 32-bit integer\n    - left shift res by 1\n        - *(this is to shift bits to the left side to make space for adding the new bit)*\n    - if n is odd, the rightmost bit is 1\n        - add 1 to res\n            - *(you can also use mod operator for even-odd check)*\n    - else n is even, the rightmost bit is 0\n        - don't do anything because the corresponding bit in res is already 0 and 0 + 0 = 0\n    - right shift n to remove a bit from the right side\n        - *(another way to do right shift is divide the number by 2)*\n- return res\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(32) â†’ O(1)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:\n        res = 0\n        for _ in range(32):\n            res <<= 1\n            if n & 1:\n                res += 1\n            n >>= 1\n        return res","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
