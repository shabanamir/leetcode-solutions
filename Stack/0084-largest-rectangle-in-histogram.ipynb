So, we will stop if we find a smaller height bar i.e we have to find the previous smaller element.\n","\n","To find the previous smaller or next smaller element, use monotonic increasing stack.\n","\n","*In a monotonic increasing stack, the elements are kept in an increasing order from bottom to top*\n","- *if the new element is greater than the previous element i.e stack top, it is pushed to the stack*\n","- *if the new element is smaller, the stack is popped until the new element becomes greater i.e until all elements that are greater than the new are removed*\n","- *the new element is the next smaller element for each popped element*\n","- *after popping all greater elements, the stack top will contain the previous smaller element*\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- create an empty stack\n","- append 0 at the end of the input array \n","    - *this is to empty the stack and calculate the area for every bar in one loop*\n","    - *0 because the min height is 0 and the stack is popped until the current height becomes greater than the stack top*\n","    - *you can skip this but you'll have to check the remaining elements in the stack at the end in a separate loop*\n","- set res = 0 to track the max area\n","- traverse the input array <br>\n","for current bar index i, current bar height h in the heights array\n","    - set j = current index to find how far to the left we can extend the current bar\n","    - loop until we find the previous smaller element i.e until the current height becomes greater than the stack top i.e while stack top element height >= current height\n","        - *(to find the previous smaller element, the stack should be in strictly increasing order i.e equal elements are not allowed that's why the loop condition is >= instead of > to remove equal elements also)*\n","        - pop stack to get the greater bar height and its index\n","            - *(stack top contains a bar with height >= current bar, we can include this bar)*\n","        - find the area and update res by taking max of current area and previous max area\n","            - *area = height * width = height * (current bar index i - previous bar index j)*\n","    - current bar is now greater, push a pair of the extended index j and current height to the stack\n","- return max_area i.e res\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(array traversal * stack top check) → O(for loop * while loop) → O(n * constt) → O(n)\n","    - *the inner while loop will not run n times for every outer iteration*\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(stack) → O(n)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:\n","        stack = []\n","        heights.append(0)\n","        res = 0\n","        for i, h in enumerate(heights):\n","            j = i\n","            while stack and stack[-1][1] >= h:\n","                j, prev_h = stack.pop()\n","                res = max(res, prev_h * (i - j))\n","            stack.append((j, h))\n","        return res"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
