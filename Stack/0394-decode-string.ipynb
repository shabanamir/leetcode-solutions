Use LIFO structure i.e stack to access the last inserted element in O(1)\n"," \n","- if you get an opening bracket, push the encoded string and k\n","- if you get a closing bracket, start decoding. Pop stack to get k and encoded string. Decode string by multiplying it with k.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- set stack = a list to represent stack\n","- set res = an empty string to track the current encoded/decoded string\n","- set k = an empty string to track the current number k\n","- traverse the input <br>\n","for each character c in string s\n","    - if c is a digit, it is part of k\n","        - add it to k\n","            - *(instead of a string concatenation, you can also use (k * 10 + int(c)) to get the current number k.
