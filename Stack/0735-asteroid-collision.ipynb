So, push it to stack \n","    - else asteroid is moving left, the direction can be opposite to the previous asteroid and they can collide\n","        - if previous asteroid (stack top) is a right-moving smaller size asteroid, both will collide and the previous asteroid will explode. So, pop all right-moving smaller-size asteroids from the stack\n","        - if stack is empty or previous asteroid is a left-moving asteroid, they will not collide because both are moving in the same direction. So, push the current asteroid\n","        - if previous is a right-moving equal-size asteroid, both will collide and explode.
