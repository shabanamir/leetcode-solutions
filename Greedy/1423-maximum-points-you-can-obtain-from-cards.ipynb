Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe need to select k cards with maximum points i.e a subarray of size k with maximum sum.\n\nUse the sliding window approach and choose the greater value card from left or right.  We can pick a card either from left or right at any point. So, start by taking k cards from one side and slide the window to maximize the points. There are two ways:\n1. start by taking all cards from the left side. Each time add a card from the right and remove a card from the left \n2. start by taking all cards from the right side. Each time add a card from the left and remove a card from the right \n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n    - if k = total number of cards, we have to choose all cards\n        - return the sum of all cards\n- set left pointer l at the start\n- set right pointer r at (n - k) position\n- set total = sum of last k cards to track total current points\n- set res = total to track the max points i.e max sum\n- start from position r and loop until the last position\n    - get current points by adding a card from the left and removing a card from the right\n        - total = add left card to total and remove right card <br>\n        total = total + left card - right card <br>\n        total += left card - right card*\n    - update res by taking max of current subarray sum and previous max sum\n        - *(this step will check which card was greater, the removed right card or the added left card, and will add it to the result)*\n    - increment l and r to move\n- return res\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(sum of last k cards + loop) → O(k + n - k) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(sliced list) → O(k)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def maxScore(self, cardPoints: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        if k == len(cardPoints):\n            return sum(cardPoints)\n        l, r = 0, len(cardPoints) - k\n        total = sum(cardPoints[r:])\n        res = total\n        while r < len(cardPoints):\n            total += cardPoints[l] - cardPoints[r]\n            res = max(res, total)\n            l += 1\n            r += 1\n        return res ","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
