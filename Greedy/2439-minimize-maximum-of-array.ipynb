Minimize Maximum of Array </center>\n","\n","\n","## Problem Description\n","[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-maximum-of-array/description/)\n","\n","\n","## Intuition\n","<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\n","1. Binary Search <br> \n","We have to minimize the max value of the array. So the result will be in the range of min(array) to max(array). Consider this range a sorted array and use binary search. Find the midpoint, if it is valid (present in the array), move left to find a smaller value, else move right to find a valid value. \n","The complexity will be n * log(max-low). log for binary search and n to check if the number is valid.\n","\n","2. Math/Greedy Approach <br> \n","The minimized max value of an array is the max of all subarray ceil averages. Compute the ceil average of each subarray and return the max.\n","    - ceil average because to minimize max of an array, we need to decrease a number and increase the other i.e to evenly distribute them. <br>\n","    For example [4, 7] <br>\n","    array max is 7 <br>\n","    find the average i.e 4 + 7 / 2 = 11/ 2 = 5.5 <br>\n","    take ceil of the average i.e 5.5 = 5 <br>\n","    5 is the minimized max of array <br>\n","    - formula for ceil of subarray average <br>\n","= ceil (subarray average) <br>\n","= ceil (subarray sum / total elements in the subarray) <br>\n","= ceil (prefix sum  till index i / index i + 1) *(i is subarray ending index)* <br>\n","= ceil (prefix sum / i + 1) <br>\n","= prefix sum + i + 1 - 1 / i + 1  *because ceil(a/b) = a + b - 1 / b* <br>\n","= prefix sum + i / i + 1\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","**Math Approach**\n","- set res = first element to track the minimized max\n","    - *(we are using the first element to skip a step. The first subarray contains only the first element. So, the sum and ceil of the first subarray is the first number.)*  \n","- set pre_sum = first element to track the sum of each subarray\n","- traverse the array starting from the second number because we have already done the computation for the first subarray \n","    - add the current number to pre_sum to include the number in the subarray\n","    - find the subarray ceil avg and update the res\n","- return res \n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: \n","    - Math Approach O(array traversal) â†’ O(n)\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","- Space complexity: \n","    - Math Approach O(1)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","    \n","    def minimizeArrayValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n","        res, pre_sum = nums[0], nums[0]\n","        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n","            pre_sum += nums[i]\n","            res = max(res, (pre_sum + i) // (i + 1))\n","        return res"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
