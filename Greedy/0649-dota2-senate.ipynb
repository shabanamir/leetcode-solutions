Dota2 Senate </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/dota2-senate/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\n- senators on the left have an earlier turn to vote\n- senators on the left compete against their counterparts on the right\n- the winner eliminates (removes from the left) the opposing senator and proceeds to the next round (moves to the right).\n\nUse a queue to insert (from right) and delete (from left) in O(1) time.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- use a separate queue for each party\n- for each senator (character c) in the senators list\n    - if c is 'D'\n        - add the position to the dire queue\n    - else add the position to the radiant que\n- loop until one of the queues is empty i.e senators will compete until there is one winner\n    - pop both queues to get the senators' position for fight/voting\n    - if the dire senator position is less, he will win because he has an early turn to vote\n        - add the dire senator position to the right of the queue to move him to the next round\n    - else move the radiant senator to the next round\n- in the end, the non-empty queue will have the winner. check the queues and return the result\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(array traversal + queue loop) → O(n + n) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(dire queue + radiant queue) → O(n + n) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def predictPartyVictory(self, senate: str) -> str:\n        dire, radiant = deque(), deque()\n        for i, c in enumerate(senate):\n            if c == 'D':\n                dire.append(i)\n            else:\n                radiant.append(i)\n        while radiant and dire:\n            d_turn = dire.popleft()\n            r_turn = radiant.popleft()\n            if d_turn < r_turn:\n                dire.append(d_turn + len(senate))\n            else:\n                radiant.append(r_turn + len(senate))\n        return 'Dire' if dire else 'Radiant'","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
