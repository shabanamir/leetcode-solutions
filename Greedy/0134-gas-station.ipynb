We have to find a station, starting from which we can travel to all other stations. We can travel to a station if we have enough gas in the tank.\n","\n","gas required to travel from station i to i+1 = gas available at station i - gas required to go to station i+1 = gas[i] - cost[i]\n","\n","Visit all gas stations and track the current gas in the tank. If the current gas in the tank becomes negative, reset it and update the start station. \n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- check base cases\n","    - if sum(gas array) < sum(cost array), we can't travel all stations, return -1 because we can only travel all the stations if sum(gas) >= sum(cost)\n","        - *(here we will not check the base case because it requires the sum of both arrays so time will be O(n + n + n) i.e O(finding gas sum + finding cost sum + finding start station), instead we will check net gas in the end. If we use this condition then there is no need to calculate or check the net gas)*\n","- set start = 0 to track the start station\n","- set net = 0 to track the net gas available\n","- set cur = 0 to track the current gas in the tank\n","- traverse all gas stations <br> \n","at each station\n","    - fill the tank and update cur i.e get the difference of gas available at the current station and gas required to reach the next\n","    - update net\n","    - if gas in the tank becomes negative i.e cur < 0\n","        - reset cur to 0 \n","        - update the start station to the current station\n","- if net gas < 0, we can't travel around the circuit\n","    - return -1\n","- else return the start station\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(array traversal) â†’ O(n)\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(1)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:\n","        # if sum(gas) < sum(cost):\n","        #     return -1\n","        start, net, cur = 0, 0, 0                  \n","        for i in range(len(gas)):  \n","            cur += gas[i] - cost[i] \n","            net += gas[i] - cost[i]          \n","            if cur < 0: \n","                cur = 0 \n","                start = i + 1\n","        return -1 if net < 0 else start  "]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
