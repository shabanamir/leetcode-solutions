Jump Game VII </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-vii/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe can move forward if:\n- current index + minJump <= next index <= min(current index + maxJump, last index)\n- value at next index is '0'\n\nNext index status (reachable or not reachable) depends on the previous. So, to solve the main problem, we need to solve the sub-problems. Use dynamic programming.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base case\n    - if the character at the last index is not 0, return false\n- set reached = 0 to track the max index reached\n- initialize an array of size equal to string size with false to track whether an index is reachable from the start or not\n- set index 0 value to true because it satisfies both conditions\n- start from the minJump index and loop till the last index\n    - update reached\n    - if the difference between current index and maxJump is greater than 0, we can't reach the current index from the start (index 0) by max jump\n        - decrement reached\n    - update the status of the current index in the dp array by checking if the index is reachable and the character at the index is '0'\n- return status of the last index i.e last value from the dp array\n    - *(if true we can reach the last index and vice versa)*\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(dp array creation + loop) → O(n + n) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(dp array) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def canReach(self, s: str, minJump: int, maxJump: int) -> bool:\n        if s[-1] != '0':\n            return False\n        reached = 0\n        dp = [False] * len(s)\n        dp[0] = True\n        for i in range(minJump, len(s)):\n            reached += dp[i - minJump]\n            if i - maxJump > 0:\n                reached -= dp[i - maxJump - 1]\n            dp[i] = reached and s[i] == '0'\n        return dp[-1] ","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
