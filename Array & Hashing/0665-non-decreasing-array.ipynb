Non-decreasing Array </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-decreasing-array/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nThe array can become non-decreasing if there is no or a single pair of adjacent elements that are not in the sorted order i.e at most a single change in order is required.\n\nTraverse the array. Compare the adjacent elements to track the total number of changes. If more than one change is required, return false.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- if there are 2 or less than 2 elements, at most one change is required, return true\n- set flag = false to track the number of changes\n- traverse the array, *start from index 1 to keep the index inbound because we are comparing adjacent elements (current and previous)*\n    - if the current element is less than the previous, we need a change in order\n        - if flag is true, we have already made a change\n            - return false\n        - set flag to true because we are making a change\n        - if the current element (nums[i]) is less than the second previous element (nums[i-2]), make the current element same as the previous element (i-1) to make the change and fix the violation in order because the previous element is guaranteed to be equal or greater than the second previous\n- if the loop completes without returning false, we have made at most 1 change, return true\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(array traversal) â†’ O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def checkPossibility(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n        if len(nums) <= 2:\n            return True\n        flag = False\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            if nums[i] < nums[i - 1]:\n                if flag:\n                    return False\n                flag = True\n                if i > 1 and nums[i] < nums[i - 2]:\n                    nums[i] = nums[i - 1]\n        return True","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
