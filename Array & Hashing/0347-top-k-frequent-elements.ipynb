Sorting O(mlogm) *(m = total distinct elements)* \n","    - use a map to store element-frequency pair\n","    - sort the pairs in decreasing order of frequency\n","    - return the first k pairs\n","2. Min Heap O(mlogk)\n","    - use a map to store element-frequency pair\n","    - create a min-heap with k pairs\n","    - traverse the remaining pairs, and pop heap if you get a high-freq pair. At the end, there will be k high-freq pairs left in the heap\n","3. Max Heap O(klogm)\n","    - use a map to store element-frequency pair\n","    - create a max-heap with m pairs\n","    - loop k times and pop heap to get the k max-freq pairs \n","4. Bucket/Index sort O(n) \n","    - Bucket sort worst time complexity is O(n²), but here we will not do sorting. We will only create n buckets and fill each bucket with elements that have the corresponding frequency i.e frequency equal to the bucket index.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- set res = a list to store the k frequent elements\n","- set count = a hashmap with a default value of 0 for each key to store the frequency of each element\n","- set freq = a 2d array of size n for bucket sort\n","    - *freq[f][n] to store the elements and their frequencies i.e element with frequency 4 will be at index 4 (bucket 4)*\n","    - *f represents the frequency*\n","    - *n represents the list of elements that have the frequency f*\n","- traverse the input array elements and get their frequencies\n","    - for each number in the input array\n","        - increment its count in the hashmap\n","- traverse the count hashmap and fill the frequency array\n","    - for each element and its count in the hashmap\n","        - add the element to the list at the index equal to its count in the freq array\n","- traverse the frequency array in reverse to get the most frequent element first\n","    - for each index in the freq array\n","        - for each element in the list at the current index\n","            - add the element to the result list\n","        - return when you get k elements \n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(input array traversal to fill hashmap + hashmap traversal to fill frequency array + frequency array traversal for k elements) → O(n + m + k) → O(n)\n","    - *m = total distinct elements*\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(frequency hashmap + frequency array + result array) → O(m + n + k) → O(n)\n","  - *frequency array is 2D but at most n elements will be stored*\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:\n","        res = []\n","        count = defaultdict(int)\n","        freq = [[] for _ in range(len(nums) + 1)]\n","        for n in nums:\n","            count[n] += 1\n","        for n, c in count.items():\n","            freq[c].append(n)\n","        for i in range(len(freq) - 1, 0, -1):\n","            for n in freq[i]:\n","                res.append(n)\n","                if len(res) == k:\n","                    return res"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
