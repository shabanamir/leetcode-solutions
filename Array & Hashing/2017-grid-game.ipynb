Grid Game </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/grid-game/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nRobot 1 can take n possible paths. Robot 2 can only move down (bottom row) or right (top row) of the column that robot 1 traversed and can collect the top row points or bottom row points.\n\nTake the max of the top and bottom row sum because robot 2 wants to maximize the points. Take the minimum of the maximum points because robot 1 wants to minimize the points.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set res = a very large number to track the total points\n- set bottom = 0 to track the bottom sum \n- set top = 0 to track the top sum\n- traverse the values in the first and second rows in parallel, *(the grid has two rows of size n, either loop in range 0 to n or use zip() for parallel traversal)*\n    - decrement the top sum\n    - update res i.e total points \n        - *(take max of bottom and top row points and then take min of their result and previous total points)*\n    - increment the bottom sum\n- return res\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(loop) → O(min(row1 size, row2 size)) → O(min(n, n)) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def gridGame(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        res = math.inf\n        bottom, top = 0, sum(grid[0])\n        for a, b in zip(grid[0], grid[1]):\n            top -= a\n            res = min(res, max(top, bottom))\n            bottom += b\n        return res","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
