Repeated DNA Sequences </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nUse a hashset and search for repeated sequences (10-size substring). Add the repeated sequences to the result.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set res = a hash set to store the repeated sequences and avoid duplicates\n- set seen = a hash set to track the repeated sequences\n- traverse the string, *loop size - 9 times to keep index inbound*\n    - get current sequence/substring of size 10\n    - if the sequence is in the seen set, it is a repeated sequence\n        - add it to the result set\n    - add the sequence to the seen set\n- convert the result set to an array and return it \n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(string traversal * substring creation + converting result set to array) → O(n-9 * 10 + n/10) → O(n + n) → O(n)\n    - *iterations = n - 9*\n    - *substring size = 10*\n    - *if every sequence is repeated twice, the result hashset will contain n/10 sequences*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(seen hashset + result hashset + substring) → O(n-9 + n/10 + 10) → O(n + n + 10) → O(n)\n    - *if every sequence is unique, the seen hashset will contain n-9 sequences because total iterations are n - 9 and in each iteration, a sequence is added*\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def findRepeatedDnaSequences(self, s: str) -> List[str]:\n        res = set()\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(len(s) - 9):\n            seq = s[i:i+10]\n            if seq in seen:\n                res.add(seq)\n            seen.add(seq)\n        return list(res)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
