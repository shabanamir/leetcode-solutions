If current day price is greater than the previous day, it is the best day to sell, sell the stock and get a profit. Else, it is the best day to buy.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- set res = 0 to track the total profit\n","- traverse the prices for each day (start from the second day)\n","    - if the current day price is greater than the previous day\n","        - get the profit and update res\n","- return res as the total profit\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(array traversal) â†’ O(n)\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(1)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:\n","        res = 0\n","        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n","            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:\n","                res += prices[i] - prices[i-1]\n","        return res"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
