Find All Anagrams in a String </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nTwo strings are anagrams if they have the same elements and the same frequency.\n\nUse the sliding window approach. Search for a window (substring) of size p in string s. If the window is valid i.e characters and frequency are the same as string p, add the window start to the result.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n  - if string p size is greater than s, there can’t be an anagram of p in s, return an empty set\n- set res = a set to store the start index of the anagrams\n- set count = a hashmap to store the character frequencies of string p for tracking the required characters\n    - *(either loop to fill the hashmap or use a library function)*\n- set left and right pointers to track the left and right sides of the window i.e set l = 0, r = 0\n- traverse the string s using the right pointer\n    - if the right character count is not 0, we found an anagram character\n      - decrement its count because we have found a required character and it is a part of current window\n          - *(remember the rule: decrement count of character if it gets inside the window and increment if it gets outside)*\n      - if current window size is valid i.e size is equal to anagram size\n        - add left pointer to res as the start index of the anagram\n      - move right pointer\n    - if left and right pointers are in the same position\n      - move both pointers\n    - else the current window is not valid because the current character count is 0 i.e it is not part of the anagram. We need to slide the window by removing a character from the left\n      - add the left character back to the hashmap because it is a required character and we have removed it\n          - *(remember the rule)*\n      - move left pointer   \n- return res\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(counting characters in string p + traversing string s) → O(m + n) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(hashmap) → O(unique characters in string p) → O(lowercase english letters) → O(26) → O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:\n        if len(p) > len(s):\n            return []\n        res = []\n        count = Counter(p)\n        l, r = 0, 0\n        while r < len(s):\n            if count[s[r]] > 0:\n                count[s[r]] -= 1\n                if r - l + 1 == len(p):\n                    res.append(l)\n                r += 1\n            elif l == r:\n                l += 1\n                r += 1\n            else:\n                count[s[l]] += 1\n                l += 1\n        return res ","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
