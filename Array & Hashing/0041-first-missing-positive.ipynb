First Missing Positive </center>\n","\n","\n","## Problem Description\n","[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/description/)\n","\n","\n","# Intuition\n","<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\n","The positive numbers we are looking for are in range 1 to n, and we need to find the smallest positive number from the range that is not present in the input. If all numbers are present, we need to return n+1\n","\n","It is the same as the [Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/description/) problem, but here the input contains out-of-bound numbers e.g negative numbers, zeros, and numbers greater than n.\n","\n","1. Hashset O(n) space <br>\n","Add the input array numbers to a set. Loop in range 1 to n and search for numbers 1 to n in the set.\n","2. Marking O(1) space <br>\n","The positive numbers are in range 1 to n and the indices are in range 0 to n-1. For example, index of number 5 = 5 - 1 = 4. Mark the indices of the present positive numbers. The first non-marked index will represent the first missing positive number. *(Before marking present positive numbers, handle out-of-bound numbers by replacing them with any positive out-of-bound number e.g n+1)* \n","3. Swapping O(1) space <br>\n","Place the numbers that are in the range 1 to n at their respective indices by swapping. For example, number 5 should be at index = 5 - 1 = 4. The index where the value is not equal to index+1 will represent the first missing positive number\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","**Hashset Approach**\n","- convert the number array into a hash set\n","- set i = 1\n","- increment i while i is present in the set\n","- return i as the first missing positive\n","\n","**Marking Approach**\n","- set n = size of the input array\n","- handle out-of-bound numbers\n","    - traverse the array\n","        - if the current number is out-of-bound i.e less than 1 (negative) or greater than n\n","            - replace it with n + 1 \n","- mark the present positive numbers\n","    - traverse the array <br>\n","    for each number in the array\n","        - if the absolute value of current number is inbound i.e in range 1 to n\n","            - get its corresponding index e.g index of 5 = 5 - 1 = 4\n","            - if the value at that index is not already marked i.e it is not negative\n","                - mark it by making it negative\n","- find the missing positive number\n","    - traverse the array\n","        - if the current number is not negative, the index is not marked \n","            - return current index + 1 as the first missing positive number\n","- if the loop completes without returning anything, all numbers in the range are present, return n + 1\n","\n","**Swapping Approach**\n","- set n = length of the array\n","- traverse the array\n","    - if the current number x is within the range 1 to n and it is not at its correct position i.e x-1\n","        - swap it with the element at index x-1\n","- traverse the array again\n","    - if the current number is not equal to the current index + 1\n","        - return index + 1 as the first missing positive\n","-  if the loop completes without returning anything, all numbers from 1 to n are present, return n + 1 \n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: \n","    - Hashset Approach O(array to set conversion + loop) → O(n + n) → O(n)\n","    - Marking Approach O(traversal to handle out-of-bound numbers + traversal to mark numbers + traversal to check numbers) → O(n + n + n) → O(n)\n","    - Swapping Approach O(traversal to swap numbers + traversal to check numbers) → O(n + n) → O(n)\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","- Space complexity:\n","    - Hashset Approach O(set) → O(n)\n","    - Marking Approach O(1)\n","    - Swapping Approach O(1)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n","        \n","        # hashset approach, O(n) space, fast\n","        nums = set(nums)\n","        i = 1\n","        while i in nums:\n","            i += 1\n","        return i\n","\n","\n","        # marking approach O(1) space\n","        n = len(nums)\n","        for i in range(n):\n","            if nums[i] < 1 or nums[i] > n:\n","                nums[i] = n + 1\n","        for num in nums:\n","            if 1 <= abs(num) <= n:\n","                i = abs(num) - 1\n","                if nums[i] > 0:\n","                    nums[i] *= -1\n","        for i in range(n):\n","            if nums[i] > 0:\n","                return i + 1\n","        return n + 1\n","        \n","        \n","        # swapping approach O(1) space\n","        n = len(nums)\n","        for i in range(n):\n","            while 1 <= nums[i] <= n and nums[i] != nums[nums[i] - 1]:\n","                nums[nums[i] - 1], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[nums[i] - 1]\n","        for i in range(n):\n","            if nums[i] != i + 1:\n","                return i + 1\n","        return n + 1 "]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
