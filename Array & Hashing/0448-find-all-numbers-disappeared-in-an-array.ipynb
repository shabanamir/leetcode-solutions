Traverse the array again. If you encounter a non-marked index i.e a positive number, it is the missing number.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- traverse the array\n","    - find the index of the current number e.g index of 5 is 4\n","    - if the index is not marked i.e number at that index is positive\n","        - mark the index by making the number at the index negative\n","    - else no need to do anything because the index is already marked means the current number is a duplicate\n","- set res = a list to store the missing numbers\n","- traverse the array again\n","    - if the index is not marked i.e number at that index is positive, it is the missing number\n","        - add the current index + 1 as missing number to the result list\n","- return the result list\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(traversal to mark indices + traversal to check indices) → O(n + n) → O(n)\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(result list) → O(missing numbers) → O(n) but the follow-up says that the result list is not considered extra memory → O(1)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n","        for n in nums:\n","            i = abs(n) - 1\n","            if nums[i] > 0:\n","                nums[i] *= -1\n","        res = []\n","        for i, n in enumerate(nums):\n","            if n > 0:\n","                res.append(i + 1)\n","        return res"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
