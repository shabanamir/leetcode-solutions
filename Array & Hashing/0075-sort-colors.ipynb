This can be done in two ways:\n","\n","1. Multiple loops\n","count the occurrences of 0, 1, and 2 (x, y, and z). Replace the first x elements of the array with 0, the next y elements with 1, and the remaining with 2.\n","\n","2. Single loop\n","use pointers to track the left and right indices. Move 0's to left and 2's to right, 1's will be auto-moved to the middle.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- use three pointers i, l, r to keep track of current, left, and right element indices\n","- while i is inbound\n","    - if current element is 0\n","      - move it to the left by swapping current element with the left index element\n","      - move current and left index pointers i.e increment l and i\n","    - if current element is 2\n","      - move it to the right by swapping it with the right index element\n","      - move right index pointer i.e decrement r\n","    - else the current element is 1\n","      - no need to move it because it is already in the middle\n","      - move current index pointer i.e increment i\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(loop) â†’ O(n)\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(1)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        i, l, r = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1\n","        while i <= r:\n","            if nums[i] == 0:\n","                nums[i], nums[l] = nums[l], nums[i]\n","                i += 1\n","                l += 1\n","            elif nums[i] == 2:\n","                nums[i], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[i]\n","                r -= 1\n","            else:\n","                i += 1"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
