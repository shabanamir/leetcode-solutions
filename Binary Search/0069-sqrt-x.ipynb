Sqrt(x) </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nThe square root of the number x is in the range 1 to x. Consider it a sorted array and use binary search to find the square root.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set left pointer l = 1 and right pointer r = x\n- set res = 0 to track the square root in case x is not a perfect square\n- while l <= r\n    - find the midpoint m\n    - if the square of m is less than x, the square root lies in the right half\n        - move left pointer and update res\n    - if the square of m is greater than x, the square root lies in the left half\n        - move the right pointer\n    - else the square of m is x (square root of x is m), return m\n- if the loop completes without returning anything, x is not a perfect square, return res\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(loop) → O(each time array is divided by 2) → O(log$_2$array size) → O(log$_2$n) → O(logn)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:\n        l, r = 1, x\n        res = 0\n        while l <= r:\n            m = (l + r) // 2\n            if m * m < x:  \n                l = m + 1\n                res = m\n            elif m * m > x:\n                r = m - 1\n            else:\n                return m\n        return res","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
