If the value at mid is greater than the target, search on the left part, else on the right.\n\nFormula for midpoint <br>\nmid = (low + high) / 2          *python* <br>\nmid = low + (high - low) / 2    *other languages to prevent integer overflow*\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set left pointer l = leftmost index and right pointer r = rightmost index\n- loop until l <= r\n    - find midpoint using the formula\n    - if the value at mid is less than the target, the target lies on the right side\n        - move left pointer i.e update l to m+1\n    - if the value at mid is greater than the target, the target lies on the left side\n        - move the right pointer i.e update r to m-1\n    - else value at mid is equal to the target, return mid as index of the target\n- if the loop completes without returning anything, the target doesn't exist in the array, return -1\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(loop) → O(each time array is divided by 2) → O(log$_2$array size) → O(log$_2$n) → O(logn)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n        l = 0\n        r = len(nums) - 1\n        while l <= r:\n            m = (l + r) // 2\n            if nums[m] < target:\n                l = m + 1\n            elif nums[m] > target:\n                r = m - 1\n            else:\n                return m\n        return -1","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
