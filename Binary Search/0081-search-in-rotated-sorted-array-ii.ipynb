Search in Rotated Sorted Array II </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nThis the same as [Search in Rotated Sorted Array I](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/) problem, but here the input contains duplicates.\n\nTo handle the duplicates, add a check for duplicates before the [original logic](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/solutions/3839163/o-logn-time-o-1-space-solution-explained/).\n\nIn a sorted array, duplicates are adjacent. To search for duplicates in a rotated sorted array, compare mid value with the left and right values. If arr[left] = arr[mid] = arr[right], the mid value is a duplicate.\n\n## Approach \n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n*Same as [Search in rotated and sorted array I solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/solutions/3839163/o-logn-time-o-1-space-solution-explained/), with a check for duplicates. Move the left and right pointers whenever you get a duplicate.*\n\n- set left pointer l = leftmost position and right pointer r = rightmost position\n- loop until l <= r\n    - find midpoint m\n    - if mid value is same as the target, return true\n    - if mid value is duplicate i.e it is same as the left and right value\n        - move both pointers i.e increment l and decrement r\n    - if the left element <= mid element, the left half is sorted\n        - if the target is in the sorted left half\n            - move the right pointer to search in the left half \n        - else the target is in the right half\n            - move the left pointer to search in the right half\n    - else right half is sorted\n        - if the target is in the sorted right half\n            - move the left pointer to search in the right half\n        - else the target is in the left half\n            - move the right pointer to search in the left half\n- if the loop executes completely without returning anything, the target is not in the array, return false\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(loop) → binary search → O(logn) → if all elements are same, we may end up doing linear search → O(n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:\n        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1\n        while l <= r:\n            m = (l + r) // 2\n            if target == nums[m]:\n                return True\n            if nums[l] == nums[m] == nums[r]:\n                l += 1\n                r -= 1\n            elif nums[l] <= nums[m]:\n                if nums[l] <= target < nums[m]:\n                    r = m - 1\n                else:\n                    l = m + 1\n            else:\n                if nums[m] < target <= nums[r]:\n                    l = m + 1\n                else:\n                    r = m -1\n        return False","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
