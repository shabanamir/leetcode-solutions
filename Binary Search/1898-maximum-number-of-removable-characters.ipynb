Consider this range a sorted array and use binary search to find k (i.e number of removable characters). If we can remove k characters i.e s remains a subsequence of p after removing the characters, search on the right half to find a max number, else search on the left half.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- set res = 0 to track the max k\n","- set left pointer l = lower boundary in the range and right pointer r = upper boundary\n","- loop until l <= r\n","    - find midpoint m\n","    - if it is possible to remove m characters \n","        - *(use the code for subsequence check here or add it in a separate function can_remove())*\n","        - set res to m \n","        - move the left pointer to search in the right half \n","    - else it is not possible \n","        - move the right pointer to search in the left half\n","- return res\n","\n","**can_remove(k)**\n","- get k elements (indices) from the removable array and add them to a hashset\n","    - *(indices are added to a hashset to search in O(1) time)*\n","- set i = 0 to track index in string s\n","- set j = 0 to track index in string p\n","- while indices are inbound\n","    - if i is not in the hashset, we don't have to remove the char at index i \n","        - if current characters in strings s and p are the same, s is currently a subsequence\n","            - increment j to check further\n","    - else we have to remove the ith char or move forward in s, so increment i\n","- check if j = size of string p and return the result\n","    - *(if it is equal, it is possible to remove k characters, so return true else false)*\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(binary search * subsequence check) → O(log(removable array size) * min(string s size, string p size)) → O(logn * string p size) → O(logn * m) → O(mlogn)\n","    - *string s size > string p size*\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(hashset) → O(max number of removable character) → O(size of removable array) → O(n)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def maximumRemovals(self, s: str, p: str, removable: List[int]) -> int:\n","        res = 0\n","        l, r = 0, len(removable)\n","\n","        def can_remove(k: int) -> bool:\n","            remove = {removable[i] for i in range(k)}\n","            i, j = 0, 0\n","            while i < len(s) and j < len(p):\n","                if i not in remove:\n","                    if s[i] == p[j]:\n","                        j += 1\n","                i += 1\n","            return j == len(p)\n","\n","        while l <= r:\n","            m = (l + r) // 2\n","            if can_remove(m):\n","                res = m \n","                l = m + 1\n","            else:\n","                r = m - 1\n","        return res"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
