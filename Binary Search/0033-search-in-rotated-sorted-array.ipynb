Search in Rotated Sorted Array </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nRotating a sorted array divides the array into two parts, both are sorted except the pivot point. So, we can use binary search.\n\nThe rotation/pivot point is where the division occurs. At pivot point\nthe next element is smaller if the main array (array before rotation) is sorted in ascending order and vice versa.\n\nExamples:\n- [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nsorted in ascending order \nrotate it three times to the left =  [5, 6, **7**, 0, 1, 2, 4], \npivot = 7 because next to 7 is 0 and 0 < 7\nboth left and right subarrays are sorted\n- [7, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1, 0]\nsorted in descending order\nrotate it three times to left = [2, 1, **0**, 7, 6, 5, 4] \npivot = 0 because next to 0 is 7 and 7 > 0\nboth left and right subarrays are sorted\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set left pointer l = leftmost position and right pointer r = rightmost position\n- loop until l <= r\n    - find midpoint m\n    - if mid value is same as the target, return m\n    - if the left element <= mid element, the left half is sorted\n        - if the target is in the sorted left half\n            - move the right pointer to search in the left half \n        - else target is in the right half\n            - move the left pointer to search in the right half\n    - else right half is sorted\n        - if the target is in the sorted right half\n            - move the left pointer to search in the right half\n        - else target is in the left half\n            - move the right pointer to search in the left half\n- if the loop executes completely without returning anything, the target is not in the array, return -1 \n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(loop) → O(each time array is divided by 2) → O(log$_2$array size) → O(log$_2$n) → O(logn)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1\n        while l <= r:\n            m = (l + r) // 2\n            if target == nums[m]:\n                return m\n            if nums[l] <= nums[m]:\n                if nums[l] <= target < nums[m]:\n                    r = m - 1\n                else:\n                    l = m + 1\n            else:\n                if nums[m] < target <= nums[r]:\n                    l = m + 1\n                else:\n                    r = m - 1\n        return -1","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
