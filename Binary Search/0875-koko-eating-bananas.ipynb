Koko Eating Bananas </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nThe maximum eating speed (k) to eat all bananas within h hours is the maximum bananas of all piles i.e max(piles). \n\nThe minimum eating seed (k) is in the range 1 to max speed. Consider it a sorted array and use binary search.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set left pointer l = 1, right pointer r = max speed i.e max(piles)\n- set res = a max number i.e max speed to track the minimum speed\n- while l < r\n    - get mid-element \n    - set time = 0 to track the time required to eat all bananas with the mid speed\n    - compute the total time required to eat all bananas in piles with mid-element speed\n        - for this, iterate all piles, get time for each pile by dividing pile size by mid-element, and update time\n        - math.ceil() is to round the result to the nearest greater integer\n    - if the time required <= h, we can finish all the bananas with this speed\n        - move the right pointer to search in the left half for a min speed\n    - else the time required is greater, we can't finish the bananas with this speed\n        - move the left pointer to search in the right half\n- return res\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(finding max + binary search * time check) → O(m + logm * n) → O(n * logm)  \n    - *m = max value in the piles*\n    - *n = piles array size*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:\n        l, r = 1, max(piles)\n        res = r\n        while l <= r:\n            m = (l + r) // 2\n            time = 0\n            for p in piles:\n                time += math.ceil(p / m)\n            if time <= h:\n                res = m\n                r = m - 1\n            else:\n                l = m + 1\n        return res","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
