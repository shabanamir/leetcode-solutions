Valid Perfect Square </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-perfect-square/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nA number is a perfect square if its square root is int, not a float. \n\nThe square root of a perfect square lies in the range 1 to perfect square. Consider it a sorted array and use binary search.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set left pointer l = 1 and right pointer r = square number (num)\n- loop until l <= r\n    - find midpoint m\n    - if the square of m is less than the square number (num)\n        - move left pointer to search in the right half\n    - if the square of m is greater than num\n        - move right pointer to search in the left half\n    - else square of m is equal to num, num is a perfect square, so return true\n- if the loop completes without returning true, num is not a perfect square, return false\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(loop) → O(each time array is divided by 2) → O(log$_2$array size) → O(log$_2$n) → O(logn)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def isPerfectSquare(self, num: int) -> bool:\n        l, r = 1, num\n        while l <= r:\n            m = (l + r) // 2\n            if m * m < num:\n                l = m + 1\n            elif m * m > num:\n                r = m - 1\n            else:\n                return True\n        return False","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
