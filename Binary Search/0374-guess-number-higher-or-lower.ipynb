Guess Number Higher or Lower </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nThe range is 1 to n. Consider it a sorted array and use binary search.\n\nIf the number we guess is higher, search on the left side for a smaller number, else on the right side for a greater number.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set left pointer l = 1 and right pointer r = n\n- loop til l <= r\n    - find the midpoint\n    - choose the midpoint number and check if it is correct i.e pass it to guess()\n    - if guess() returns 1, the midpoint number is smaller\n        -  move the left pointer to search in the right half for a greater number\n    - if guess() returns -1, the midpoint number is greater\n        - move the right pointer to search in the left part for a smaller number\n    - else it is 0, the midpoint number is correct, return it\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(loop) → O(each time array is divided by 2) → O(log$_2$array size) → O(log$_2$n) → O(logn)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# The guess API is already defined for you.\n# @param num, your guess\n# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number\n#          1 if num is lower than the picked number\n#          otherwise return 0\n# def guess(num: int) -> int:\n\n\nclass Solution:\n\n    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:\n        l, r = 1, n\n        while l <= r:\n            mid = (l + r) // 2\n            x = guess(mid)\n            if x == 1:\n                l = mid + 1\n            elif x == -1:\n                r = mid - 1\n            else:\n                return mid","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
