Car Pooling </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-pooling/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\n**Approach 1** <br>\nAt every station, some passengers get on board, and some drop off. Get the number of onboarded passengers at each station. If the number of passengers is more than the capacity, return false.\n\nThe time and space complexity will be constant, O(1000) → O(1), no matter the number of trips or stations.\n\n**Approach 2** <br>\nSort the trips based on starting time to process the earlier trips first. Find the trips that end before a current trip to remove (drop off) those trips' passengers. To find the previous trip, use min heap because the previous trip end time is less than the current, and min heap returns min element in O(1) time.\n\n# Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n**Approach 1**\n- create a list of size 1001 to track the number of onboard passengers at each station\n    - (*total stations <= 1000, 1001 to keep the index inbound*)\n- set total = 0 to track the total number of onboard passengers\n- traverse trips  \nfor each trip passengers, start and end time      \n    - pick up passengers i.e add the current trip passengers to the start station\n    - drop off passengers i.e remove the passengers from the end station\n- traverse the onboard at each station i.e loop 1000 times\n    - add the current station passengers to the total\n    - if total > capacity, return false\n- if the loop completes without returning false, we can process all trips, return true\n\n**Approach 2**\n- create a min heap \n- sort trips based on the start time\n- set total = 0 to track the total number of onboard passengers\n- traverse trips\nfor each trip passengers, start and end time\n    - drop off the previous trip's passengers \n        - loop until heap top element (previous trip ending time) <= current trip start time\n            - get the number of passengers in the previous trip i.e heap top element and decrement the total\n            - pop the heap top\n    - add current trip passengers to total\n    - if total > car capacity, we can't process the current trip, return false\n    - else we can process the current trip, push the current trip ending time and passengers to heap\n- if the loop completes without returning false, we can process all trips, return true\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity:\n    - Approach 1 O(creating at_station list + trips traversal + passengers traversal) → O(1000 + n + 1000) → n <= 1000 → O(1000 + 1000 + 1000) → O(1)\n    - Approach 2 O(sort + trip traversal * heap push pop) → O(nlogn + n * log(heap size)) → O(nlogn + n * logn) → O(nlogn)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity:\n    - Approach 1 O(at_station list) → O(1000) → O(1)\n    - Approach 2 O(sort + heap) → O(n + n) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:\n        # O(1) time\n        on_board = [0] * 1001\n        total = 0\n        for passengers, start, end in trips:\n            on_board[start] += passengers\n            on_board[end] -= passengers\n        for passengers in on_board:\n            total += passengers\n            if total > capacity:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n        # O(nlogn) time \n        min_heap = []\n        trips.sort(key = lambda x:x[1])\n        total = 0\n        for passengers, start, end in trips:\n            while min_heap and min_heap[0][0] <= start:\n                total -= min_heap[0][1]\n                heapq.heappop(min_heap)\n            total += passengers\n            if total > capacity:\n                return False\n            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (end, passengers))\n        return True","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
