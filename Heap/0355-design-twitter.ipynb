Queue and stack allow insertion and deletion at the top in O(1) time. \n","\n","For the following list, use hashmap with key as follower id and value as a set of followee ids to insert (follow user) and delete (unfollow user) in O(1) time.\n","\n","To get the most recent tweets, add a time stamp to the tweet. Maintain a timer in decreasing order so that the most recent tweets will have the smallest values as compared to the least recent. Use a min heap to get the recent tweets i.e tweets with the smallest timestamp because the min heap returns the smallest value in O(1) time.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","**init()**\n","- set timer = 0 to track the timestamp\n","- create a hashmap for tweets\n","    - *key = user id*\n","    - *value = queue of tweets*\n","- create a hashmap for followees\n","    - *key = follower id*\n","    - *value = set of followee ids*\n","\n","**postTweet()**\n","- decrement the timer\n","- add the tweet (timer, tweet id) to the top/left of the queue for the user\n","\n","**getNewsFeed()**\n","- get the tweets posted by the user or its followees \n","- sort the tweets from most recent to least recent.
