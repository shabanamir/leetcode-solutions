The cpu takes 1 unit of time to process a task. The cpu can execute the tasks in any order but can't execute similar tasks together. To execute similar tasks, the cpu must wait for time n. During that time, if there are any other tasks, the cpu can process them otherwise it will remain idle. We have to return the min time required to process the tasks i.e we have to minimize the total idle time.\n","\n","It is the same as placing similar characters n distance apart in the result. To minimize the total time, start with the most frequent character (task) first. After adding the most frequent char, wait n times before adding it again, and in that time process a different char.\n","\n","Examples:\n","1. **tasks = ['A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B'], n = 2** <br>\n","There are two kinds of characters (tasks) i.e A and B and we have to separate them by 2 intervals before repeating any of them. <br>\n","We have to place similar characters 2 distances apart i.e after adding A there should be two other different characters, same is the case for B. If there are not 2 other characters, add idle to represent cpu is idle. <br>\n","A → B → idle → A → B → idle → A → B <br>\n","total time = size of execution array = 8\n","\n","2. **tasks = ['A', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'D', 'B'], n = 1** \n","separate similar characters by 1 interval <br>\n","A → B → C → D → A → B <br>\n","total time = 6\n","3. **tasks = ['A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B'], n = 3** \n","separate similar characters by 3 intervals <br>\n","A → B → idle → idle → A → B → idle → idle → A → B <br>\n","total time = 10\n","\n","Approaches to solve this problem\n","1. Max Heap <br>\n","Use max heap to find the most frequent task because max heap returns max element in O(1) time\n","\n","2. Math Formula <br>\n","min time required to complete all tasks <br>\n","= max(total no.of tasks, total time slots) <br>\n","= max(total no. of tasks, (most frequent task frequency - 1) * (cooldown period + 1) + total no. of most frequent tasks)\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","**Heap Approach**\n","- set res = 0 to track the total time for execution for all tasks\n","- find the count (frequency) of each task\n","    - *(either use a library class or do it from scratch by creating a hashmap and filling it)*\n","- create a max heap by storing the count of each task to execute the most frequent task first\n","    - *(Python's heap library doesn't have a max heap class. We can implement the max heap using the min heap class by inverting the values. Flip the signs and then push the numbers to the heap. In this way, the largest number becomes the smallest and moves to the heap top)* \n","- create a queue to find which repeated task is ready for execution\n","- loop until all tasks are processed\n","    - increment res because in each iteration the cpu is either processing a task or remains idle and both operations take 1 unit of time\n","    - if the heap is not empty\n","        - pop heap to get the most frequent task count and decrement it by 1 because we are processing this task\n","            - *(increment in this case because we flipped the sign while adding elements to max heap i.e we added the negative count)*\n","        - if current task count is not 0 i.e the task is a repeated task \n","            - add the task count, and wait time to the queue because we have to wait this much time before executing this task again\n","                - *wait time = current time + n*\n","    - if the queue is not empty and the queue's front task wait time is equal to the current time, the task is ready to execute\n","        - pop queue to remove the task and push it to the heap for execution\n","- return res\n","                         \n","**Formula Approach**\n","- find the count (frequency) of each task\n","    - *(either use a library class or do it from scratch by creating a hashmap and filling it)*\n","- find the most frequent task frequency i.e task with max count\n","- count the most frequent tasks i.e tasks with the same count as the max count)\n","- compute the time slots required to complete all tasks, using the formula \n","    - *total slots = (most frequent task frequency - 1) * (cooldown period + 1) + number of most frequent tasks*\n","- return the max of the total time slots and the total tasks to get the min time required to complete all tasks\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: \n","    - Heap Approach O(counter + creating heap list + heapify + loop * heap push/pop) → O(tasks + 26 + heap size + total tasks * total idle time * log(heap size)) → O(n + 26 + 26 + n * m * log26) → O(n + 26 + 26 + n * 100 * log26) → O(n + n) → O(n)\n","        - *n here is the size of input array not the cool down period*\n","        - *heap size = counter hashmap size = total unique tasks names = uppercase english letters = 26*\n","        - *loop will execute until all tasks are processed i.e total tasks * total idle time required*\n","    - Math Approach O(counter + finding max + creating most frequent tasks list + sum) → O(n + 26 + 26 + 26) → O(n)\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","- Space complexity: \n","    - Heap Approach O(counter hashmap + heap + queue) → O(26 + 26 + 26) → O(1)\n","    - Math Approach O(counter hashmap + most frequent tasks list) → O(26 + 26) → O(1)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:\n","        \n","        # heap approach\n","        res = 0\n","        count_tasks = Counter(tasks)\n","        max_heap = [-count for count in count_tasks.values()]\n","        heapq.heapify(max_heap)\n","        q = deque()\n","        while max_heap or q:\n","            res += 1\n","            if max_heap:\n","                count = 1 + heapq.heappop(max_heap)\n","                if count:\n","                    q.append([count, res + n])\n","            if q and q[0][1] == res:\n","                heapq.heappush(max_heap, q.popleft()[0])\n","        return res\n","\n","        # math approach\n","        count_task = Counter(tasks)\n","        max_count = max(count_task.values())\n","        max_tasks = sum(1 for count in count_task.values() if count == max_count)\n","        n_slots= (max_count - 1) * (n + 1) + max_tasks\n","        return max(n_slots, len(tasks))"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
