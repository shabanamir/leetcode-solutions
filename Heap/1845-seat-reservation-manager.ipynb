Seat Reservation Manager </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/seat-reservation-manager/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe need to reserve the smallest-numbered unreserved seat. Use min heap because it returns the smallest element in O(1) time. \n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n**init()**\n- create a list for min heap and add all the numbers (seats) in the range 1 to n\n    - *(no need to use heapify() because the list already satisfies the min heap properties i.e the numbers are in ascending sorted order)*\n\n**reserve()**\n- pop heap to get the minimum number and return it\n\n**unreserve()**\n- push the given number to the heap\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity:\n    - init() O(creating heap) → O(n)\n    - reserve() O(heap pop) → O(log(heap size)) → O(logn)\n    - unreserve() O(heap push) → O(log(heap size)) → O(logn)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity:\n    - init() O(heap) → O(n)\n    - reserve() O(1)\n    - unreserve() O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class SeatManager:\n\n    def __init__(self, n: int):\n        self.seats = [i for i in range(1, n + 1)]\n\n    def reserve(self) -> int:\n        return heapq.heappop(self.seats)\n\n    def unreserve(self, seatNumber: int) -> None:\n        heapq.heappush(self.seats, seatNumber)\n        \n\n\n# Your SeatManager object will be instantiated and called as such:\n# obj = SeatManager(n)\n# param_1 = obj.reserve()\n# obj.unreserve(seatNumber)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
