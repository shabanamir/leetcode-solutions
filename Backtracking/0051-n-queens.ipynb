N-Queens </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe are given n x n chessboard and n queens. We need to return the valid board configurations. A configuration is valid if the queens are placed in a way that they will not attack each other.\n\nA queen can move in any direction i.e top, bottom, left, right, and across the diagonals. We need to place each queen in a different row, column, and diagonal so they will not be able to attack.\n\nUse backtracking to explore all possible paths/configurations and check if it is valid. A path is valid if there is no queen placed in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\nTo speed up the process, don't check every cell. There are n queens and n rows and we need to place each in a row. So, for every row find a position (column) that will not result in a clash. For this track the occupied columns and diagonals. Use hash set to track/search, insert, and remove in O(1) time.\n\nThe left diagonal can be determined by row - column. In the left diagonal, we move downwards, the row and column both increase by 1, and therefore the row - column remains the same.\n\nThe right diagonal can be determined by row + column. In the right diagonal, we move upwards, the row decreases by 1, the column increases by 1, and therefore row + column remains the same.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- create three sets to track the occupied columns, left diagonals, and right diagonals\n- initialize a board of size n x n with dots to represent the empty cells\n- create a list to store the valid board configurations\n- define a helper function for backtracking <br>\nbacktrack(row index)\n    - if current row is the last row, we have traversed all rows and placed the queens\n        - the current configuration is valid, add it to the result list\n            - *(convert the current board configuration (nxn matrix) to a list of strings i.e convert each row to a string and add all rows to a list)*\n        - return\n    - for each column \n        - if there is a clash i.e current col or right diagonal or left diagonal is occupied\n            - skip because we can't choose it to place the queen\n        - else we can choose it\n            - add current column, left and right diagonal to the sets to mark them as occupied\n            - place the queen in the current cell\n            - backtrack to explore other paths\n            - free the column, diagonals, and cell\n- start backtracking from the first row at index 0\n- return the result\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(board + recursion breadth) → O(rows * columns + calls at each level ^ total levels) → O(n * n + columns ^ rows) → O(n$^2$ + n$^n$) → O(n$^n$) \n    - *for each row (level), we make n choices (calls) to find the column to place the queen*\n    - *we will not consider the time complexity of join() because we are not converting and adding every configuration, we are only adding the valid configurations to the result*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(recursion stack + set + board + result list) → O(recursion depth/levels + n + rows * cols + n strings each of size n) → O(n + n + n * n + n * n) → O(n$^2$ + n$^2$) → O(n$^2$)\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def solveNQueens(self, n: int) -> List[List[str]]:\n        cols = set()\n        right_diag = set() \n        left_diag = set()\n        board = [['.'] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        res = []\n\n        def backtrack(r: int) -> None:\n            if r == n:\n                res.append([''.join(row) for row in board])\n                return\n            for c in range(n):\n                if c in cols or (r + c) in right_diag or (r - c) in left_diag:\n                    continue\n                cols.add(c)\n                right_diag.add(r + c)\n                left_diag.add(r - c)\n                board[r][c] = 'Q'\n                backtrack(r + 1)\n                cols.remove(c)\n                right_diag.remove(r + c)\n                left_diag.remove(r - c)\n                board[r][c] = '.'\n\n        backtrack(0)\n        return res","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
