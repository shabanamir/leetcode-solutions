A configuration is valid if the queens are placed in a way that they will not attack each other.\n","\n","A queen can move in any direction i.e top, bottom, left, right, and across the diagonals. We need to place each queen in a different row, column, and diagonal so they will not be able to attack.\n","\n","Use backtracking to explore all possible paths/configurations and check if it is valid. A path is valid if there is no queen placed in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n","\n","To speed up the process, don't check every cell. There are n queens and n rows and we need to place each in a row. So, for every row find a position (column) that will not result in a clash. For this track the occupied columns and diagonals. Use hash set to track/search, insert, and remove in O(1) time.\n","\n","The left diagonal can be determined by row - column. In the left diagonal, we move downwards, the row and column both increase by 1, and therefore the row - column remains the same.\n","\n","The right diagonal can be determined by row + column. In the right diagonal, we move upwards, the row decreases by 1, the column increases by 1, and therefore row + column remains the same.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","Same as [N Queens I Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/solutions/3947046/o-n-n-time-o-n-space-solution-explained/), only count the valid paths instead of storing them.\n","- create three sets to track the occupied columns, left diagonals, and right diagonals\n","- set res = 0 to track the total number of valid configurations\n","- define a helper function for backtracking <br>\n","backtrack(row index)\n","    - if current row is the last row, we have traversed all rows and placed the queens\n","        - make res non local\n","            - *(this is done to access outer function variables in nested functions)*\n","        - increment res because the current configuration is valid\n","        - return\n","    - for each column \n","        - if there is a clash i.e current col or right diagonal or left diagonal is occupied\n","            - skip because we can't choose it to place the queen\n","        - else we can choose it to place a queen\n","            - add current column, left and right diagonal to the sets to mark them as occupied\n","            - backtrack to explore other paths\n","            - free the column, diagonals, and cell\n","- start backtracking from the first row at index 0\n","- return res\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(recursion breadth) → O(calls at each level ^ total levels) → O(columns ^ rows) → O(n$^n$)\n","    - *for each row (level), we make n choices (calls) to find the column to place the queen*\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(recursion stack + set) → O(recursion depth/levels + n) → O(n + n) → O(n)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def totalNQueens(self, n: int) -> int:\n","        cols = set()\n","        right_diag = set() \n","        left_diag = set()\n","        res = 0\n","\n","        def backtrack(r: int) -> None:\n","            if r == n:\n","                nonlocal res\n","                res += 1\n","                return\n","            for c in range(n):\n","                if c in cols or (r + c) in right_diag or (r - c) in left_diag:\n","                    continue\n","                cols.add(c)\n","                right_diag.add(r + c)\n","                left_diag.add(r - c)\n","                backtrack(r + 1)\n","                cols.remove(c)\n","                right_diag.remove(r + c)\n","                left_diag.remove(r - c)\n","\n","        backtrack(0)\n","        return res"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
