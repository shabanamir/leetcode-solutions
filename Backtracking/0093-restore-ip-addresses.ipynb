Restore IP Addresses </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-ip-addresses/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe are given digits and we have to return all valid IP address combinations.\n\nA valid IP address consists of 4 blocks. Each block \n- is separated by a dot\n- contains an integer in the range 0 to 255\n- contains up to 3 digits\n\nWe need to explore all possible combinations and check if it is valid. Use backtracking to explore all possible combinations.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n    - if the input string size is more than 12, there can't be a valid combination because an ip address can't have more than 12 digits\n        - return an empty list\n- create a list to store valid combinations\n- define a helper function for backtracking <br>\nbacktrack(start position i.e current digit index, current path/combination)\n    - if there are 4 elements/blocks in the current combination and the current start position is the last position i.e we have used all digits, the current combination is valid\n        - add the string form of the current combination to the result and return\n    - else if we have four blocks in the current combinations and we have not used all digits or we have used all digits but the current combination doesn't contain 4 blocks\n        - return because the current combination is not valid\n    - loop to generate the four blocks using backtracking\n        - if the current position is out of bound\n            - return\n        - if there is a leading 0\n            - return\n        - get the number (substring) representing the current block\n        - if the number is greater than 255:\n            - return\n        - else backtrack to explore and generate the other blocks\n- start backtracking from the first digit at index 0\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(recursion breadth) → O(calls at each level ^ total levels) → O(3^4) → O(81) → O(1)\n    - *total levels = total blocks in an ip address = 4*\n    - *calls at each level = digits in a single block = 3*\n    - *we will not consider the time complexity of join() because join() is not called in each recursion and it complexity is O(4) because it is joining 4 blocks by a dot*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(recursion stack + result list) → O(recursion depth/levels + total combinations) → O(4 + 19) → O(1)\n    - *there is no relation between the input digits and output IP addresses. At most, there can be 19 total combinations in case the input is 11111111*\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def restoreIpAddresses(self, s: str) -> List[str]:\n        if len(s) > 12:\n            return []\n        res = []\n\n        def backtrack(start: int, path: List[int]) -> None:\n            if len(path) == 4 and start == len(s):\n                res.append('.'.join(path))\n                return\n            if len(path) == 4 or start == len(s):\n                return\n            for length in range(1, 4):\n                if start + length > len(s):\n                    return \n                if length > 1 and s[start] == '0':\n                    return \n                num = s[start: start + length]\n                if int(num) > 255:\n                    return\n                backtrack(start + length, path + [num])\n\n        backtrack(0, [])\n        return res","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
