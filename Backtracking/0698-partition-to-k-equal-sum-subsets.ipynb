Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-to-k-equal-sum-subsets/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe need to find if it is possible to divide the array into k subsets of equal sum.\n\nThe sum of each subset should be equal to  sum(array) / k\n\nFor each element, we can make two choices:\n- include it in the subset\n- don't include...\n\nUse backtracking to explore all possible subsets and check if it is a valid subset i.e sum(subset) = sum(array) / k. To speed up the process, sort the array and use hash set.\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- find the total sum of the array\n- check base cases \n    - if the total sum is not divisible by k, it is not possible to have k subsets of equal sum, return false\n- sort the array in descending order\n- find the target sum for the subset\n- create a hashset to check for duplicates\n    - *(we will add indices to the hashset, if an index is in the hashset it means we have used that index element)*\n- define a helper function for backtracking <br>\nbacktrack(current index, remaining subsets, current subset sum)\n    - if we have found k subsets, return true\n    - if current subset sum is equal to the target sum, we have found a subset\n        - backtrack to find remaining subsets and return the result if it is possible to find the subsets\n    - loop in range i to size of array to check for the remaining elements in the array\n        - if current element is a duplicate i.e the index is inbound and we have not used the previous element and previous element is same as the current\n            - skip\n        - if the current element is already used i.e its index is in the hashset or adding it to the current subset will exceed the target sum\n            - skip\n        - add current element index to the hashset to include it in the current subset\n        - backtrack to find the k subsets, return true if it is possible\n        - remove current element index from the set\n    - if the loop executes without returning true, it is not possible to divide the array into k subsets, return false\n- start backtracking from the first element at index 0\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(sum + sort + recursion breadth for k subsets) → O(n + nlogn + calls at each level ^ total levels * k) → O(n + nlogn + 2$^n$ * k) → O(k * 2$^n$)\n    - *n = total elements in the array*\n    - *2 = for each element, we make two choices i.e include or exclude*\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n- Space complexity: O(sort + hashset + recursion stack) → O(n + n + recursion depth/levels) → O(n + n + n) → O(n)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def canPartitionKSubsets(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:\n        total = sum(nums)\n        if total % k:\n            return False\n        nums.sort(reverse = True)\n        target = total / k\n        seen = set()\n\n        def backtrack(i: int, k: int, cur: int) -> bool:\n            if k == 0:\n                return True\n            if target == cur:\n                return backtrack(0, k - 1, 0)\n            for j in range(i, len(nums)):\n                if j > 0 and (j - 1) not in seen and nums[j] == nums[j - 1]:\n                    continue\n                if j in seen or cur + nums[j] > target:\n                    continue\n                seen.add(j)\n                if backtrack(j + 1, k, cur + nums[j]):\n                    return True\n                seen.remove(j)\n            return False\n\n        return backtrack(0, k, 0)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
