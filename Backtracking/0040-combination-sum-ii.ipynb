A combination is valid if it contains unique elements and the sum of the elements is equal to the target.\n","\n","To avoid duplicate combinations, we can make two choices for an element:\n","- include the element in the combination and move ahead because a number can only appear once in a combination\n","- don't include the element and move ahead\n","\n","Use bactracking to explore all combinations and check if it is valid. As input contains duplicates, sort the input first to group duplicates and avoid recursion for them.\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","*Same as the [Combinations Sum I solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/solutions/3917442/o-2-n-time-o-n-space-solution-explained/), only sort the input to handle duplicates and backtrack from the next index so that each number appears only once in a combination.*\n","- sort the input list\n","- create a result list to store the valid combinations\n","- define a helper function for backtracking <br>\n","backtrack(current index, current combination sum, current path/ combination)\n","    - if current combination sum is equal to the target, it is a valid combination\n","        - add a copy of the current combination to the result list and return\n","            - *(add the copy to avoid overwriting this combination during future backtracking)*\n","    - if the index is out of bounds or current combination sum is not valid, return\n","    - add the current index element to the current combination and backtrack from next index i.e i + 1 to explore combinations with the current element\n","        - *(a number can only appear once in a combination, so we backtrack from the next index)*\n","    - remove the current index element from the current combination\n","    - increment the index while there are duplicates i.e current and next element are the same\n","    - backtrack from the next index i.e i + 1 to explore combinations without the current element\n","- start backtracking from index 0\n","- return the result list\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(sort + recursion breadth) → O(nlogn + calls at each level ^ total levels) → O(nlogn + 2$^n$) → O(2$^n$)\n","    - *we will not consider the time complexity of copy here because we are not copying and adding every combination that is generated to our result*\n","    - *same goes for the while loop used to skip duplicates because it will not run n times in each recursion*\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","- Space complexity: (sort + recursion stack + result list) → (n + recursion depth/levels + n) → O(n + n + n) → O(n)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def combinationSum2(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n","        candidates.sort() \n","        res = []\n","\n","        def backtrack(i: int, total: int, path: List[int]) -> None:\n","            if total == target:\n","                res.append(path.copy())\n","                return \n","            if i >= len(candidates) or total > target:\n","                return\n","            path.append(candidates[i])\n","            backtrack(i + 1, total + candidates[i], path)\n","            path.pop()\n","            while i + 1 < len(candidates) and candidates[i] == candidates[i + 1]:\n","                i = i + 1\n","            backtrack(i + 1, total, path)\n","\n","        backtrack(0, 0, [])\n","        return res"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
