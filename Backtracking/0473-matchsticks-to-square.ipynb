Find the length of a single side and use backtracking to find the number of possible combinations (matchsticks) that can sum up to that length.\n","\n","single side length = perimeter / 4 = sum of all matchsticks / 4\n","\n","Sort the matchsticks in decreasing order so that bigger matchsticks will get processed earlier and will lead to a negative conclusion first if there is no solution.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- check base cases\n","    - if there are less than 4 matchsticks available, we can't make a square, return false\n","    - if the perimeter is not divisible by 4 or the bigger matchstick is greater than the length of a single side, we can't make a square, return false\n","- sort the matchsticks in decreasing order\n","- initialize an array of size 4 to track the current length of the 4 sides \n","- use a helper function to backtrack <br>\n","backtrack(current index)\n","    - if the current index is the last, we have processed all sticks and sides and can form a square\n","        - return True\n","    - for each of the 4 sides\n","        - if current matchstick is valid i.e adding the current index matchstick to the current side results in a length less than or equal to the actual required length\n","            - add the current matchstick length to the side \n","            - backtrack to check if we can add any more matchsticks to the current side i.e explore all combinations including the current matchstick, return true if we can\n","            - remove the current matchstick to explore combinations excluding the current matchstick\n","    - if the loop completes without returning true, there is no combination of matchsticks that can sum up to the side of a square, return false\n","- start backtracking from the first matchstick at index 0 and return the result\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(recursion breadth) → O(calls at each level ^ total levels) → O(4$^n$)\n","    - *4 = total sides of a square*\n","    - *n = total matchsticks*\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(recursion stack) → O(recursion depth/levels) → O(n)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def makesquare(self, matchsticks: List[int]) -> bool:\n","        if len(matchsticks) < 4:\n","            return False\n","        perimeter = sum(matchsticks)\n","        length = perimeter // 4\n","        if perimeter % 4 or max(matchsticks) > length:\n","            return False\n","        matchsticks.sort(reverse=True)\n","        sides = [0] * 4\n","\n","        def backtrack(i: int) -> bool:\n","            if i == len(matchsticks):\n","                return True\n","            for j in range(4):\n","                if sides[j] + matchsticks[i] <= length:\n","                    sides[j] += matchsticks[i]\n","                    if backtrack(i + 1):\n","                        return True\n","                    sides[j] -= matchsticks[i]\n","            return False\n","\n","        return backtrack(0)"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
