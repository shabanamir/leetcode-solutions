So, to solve the main problem (string segmentation), we have to solve the sub-problems (substring segmentation), use dynamic programming.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- set dp = a boolean array of size len(s) + 1, where dp[i] represents whether the substring up to index i can be segmented \n","    - *index = substring size*\n","    - *value = is it possible to segment*\n","- set value at index 0 to True, because an empty string can always be segmented\n","- for every substring in the string s, check if the substring can be segmented\n","    - for each index (substring size) i \n","        - for each word w in the dictionary\n","            - if current index (substring size) >= current word size and substring before the current can be segmented and the current substring ends with the current word\n","                - the current substring can be segmented, set dp[i] to true\n","                - no need to check the remaining words, break the inner loop\n","- return the last index value from the dp array i.e dp[-1] that represents whether the entire string s can be segmented or not\n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(dp array creation + outer loop * inner loop * endswith() for substring check) → O(input string size + input string size * words array size * max substring size) → O(m + m * n * 20) → O(m * n)\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(dp array) → O(string s size) → O(m)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:\n","        dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1)\n","        dp[0] = True\n","        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):\n","            for w in wordDict:\n","                if i >= len(w) and dp[i - len(w)] and s[:i].endswith(w):\n","                    dp[i] = True\n","                    break\n","        return dp[-1]"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
