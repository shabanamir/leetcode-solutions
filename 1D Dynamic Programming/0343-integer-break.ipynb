Integer Break </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\n- Approach 1: O(n/3) <br>\nn = 10, max product = 3 x 3 x 4 <br>\nn = 11, max prduct = 3 x 3 x 3 x 2 <br>\nIf we observe the pattern, the max product is obtained by repeatedly cutting parts of size 3 while the size is greater than 4, keeping the last part as 2, 3, or 4.\n- Approach 2: O(log(n/3)) <br>\nAccording to the maxima-minima concept, an integer n should be broken down into equal parts x to maximize the product (x$^{n/x}$). The value of x should be e (natural log base). As 2 < e < 3, x should be 2 or 3. <br>\nSo we will keep breaking the integer n in power of 3 only, until n becomes 4 or 2. <br>\nMax product = 3$^{n/3}$ x last part  (last part can be 4, 2, or null)\n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- check base cases\n    - if n <= 3, the max prdouct is n - 1 \n        - *n = 2 break into 1 + 1, max product = 1 x 1 = 1*\n        - *n = 3 break into 2 + 1, max product = 2 x 1 = 2*\n- find the last part and get the product of the power of 3 and the last part\n    - if n is divisible by 3, there's no last part, return 3$^{n/3}$\n        - *n = 6 break it into 3 + 3* \n    - if n mode 3 is 1, the last part is 4, return 3$^{n/3 - 1}$ * 4\n        - *n = 10 break into 3 + 3 + 4* \n    - else n mode 3 is 2, last part is 2, return 3$^{n/3}$ * 2\n        - *n = 11 break into 3 + 3 + 3 + 2*\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(power) → O(log(exponent)) → O(log(n/3))\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def integerBreak(self, n: int) -> int:\n        if n <= 3:\n            return n - 1\n        if n % 3 == 0:\n            return 3 ** (n // 3)\n        if n % 3 == 1:\n            return 3 ** ((n // 3) - 1) * 4\n        return 3 ** (n // 3) * 2","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
