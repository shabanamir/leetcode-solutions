So, to solve the main problem (stickers required for the main string), we need to solve the sub-problems (stickers required for the substring). Use dynamic programming.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- set subsets = total subsets (substrings) of target string i.e $2^{target\\:string\\:size}$\n","- set dp = an array of size equal to total subsets with default value of a very large number i.e float infinity where dp[i] represents minimum stickers required to spell the ith subset\n","- set dp[0] to 0 because no sticker is required to spell an empty string\n","- create a hashmap to store the target string characters and indices \n","    - *key = character*\n","    - *value = list of indices of the character occurrences*\n","    - *we are using a hashmap to avoid the loop to check if the sticker character is present in the target string*\n","- traverse all the subsets <br>\n","for each subset i\n","    - skip if we can't reach that subset from the starting subset\n","    - traverse the stickers to find stickers that can be used to spell the current subset <br>\n","    for each sticker in the stickers list\n","        - set cur = current subset i\n","        - for each character in the current sticker\n","            - if the character is present in the target string\n","                - loop over its indices in the target string\n","                    - if the current subset doesn't contain the character (i.e the corresponding bit is not set)\n","                        - add the character to the current subset i.e set the corresponding bit to 1 and break the loop\n","                        - break the loop\n","        - update dp[cur] with the minimum number of required stickers \n","- *the last value in the dp array represents the minimum number of stickers required to spell the last subset (i.e target string)* <br>\n","return the last value if we can create the target string i.e the value is not equal to float infinity, else return -1 \n","\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(dp array creation + hashmap filling + subsets traversal * stickers traversal * sticker characters traversal * matching character indices traversal) → O(total subsets + target string size + total subsets * stickers * max size sticker * target string size) → O(2$^m$ + m + 2$^m$ * n * k * m) → O(2$^m$ * n * k * m) → O(2$^m$ * n * 10 * 15) → O(2$^m$ * n) \n","    - *m = target string size*\n","    - *n = stickers array size*\n","    - *k = max sticker size <= 10*\n","    - *target string size <= 15, if all characters are the same, the 4th nested loop will run 15 times*\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(dp array + hashmap) → O(total subsets + target string size) → O(2$^m$ + m) → O(2$^m$)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def minStickers(self, stickers: List[str], target: str) -> int:\n","        subsets = 1 << len(target)\n","        dp = [float('inf')] * subsets\n","        dp[0] = 0\n","        target_map = defaultdict(list)\n","        for i, c in enumerate(target):\n","            target_map[c].append(i)\n","        for i in range(subsets):\n","            if dp[i] == float('inf'):\n","                continue\n","            for sticker in stickers:\n","                cur = i\n","                for c in sticker:\n","                    if c in target_map:\n","                        for j in target_map[c]:\n","                            if not (cur >> j & 1):\n","                                cur |= 1 << j \n","                                break\n","                dp[cur] = min(dp[cur], dp[i] + 1)\n","        return dp[-1] if dp[-1] != float('inf') else -1"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
