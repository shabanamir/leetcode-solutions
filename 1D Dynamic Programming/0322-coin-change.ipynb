Coin Change </center>\n\n\n## Problem Description\n[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/description/)\n\n\n## Intuition\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\nWe are given a list of coins and can use each coin any number of times. We need to find the minimum number of coins required to make the target amount.\n\nIf we choose a coin from the coins list, <br>\nmin coins required to make target amount = 1 + min coins required to make the remaining amount <br>\n*(1 because we have chosen a coin)*\n\nFor example: <br>\ncoins = [1, 3, 4], target amount = 7 \n- if we choose coin 1 <br>\nremaining amount = target amount - coin value = 7 - 1 = 6 <br>\nmin coins required to make amount 7 = 1 + min coins required to amount 6\n- if we choose coin 3 <br>\nremaining amount = 7 - 3 = 4 <br>\nmin coins to make amount 7 = 1 + min coins required to make amount 4\n- if we choose 4 <br>\nremaining amount = 7 - 4 = 3 <br>\nmin coins to make amount 7 = 1 + min coins required to make amount 3\n\nSo, each time we also need to find the minimum coins to make the remaining amount i.e to solve the main problem (target amount), we need to solve the sub-problem (remaining amount). Use dynammic programming. \n\nFor each amount in the range 0 to target amount, traverse all coins and find the min coins that can make that amount. \n\n\n## Approach\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n- set m = a value greater than the target amount i.e amount + 1\n- set dp = a list of size m where dp[i] represents the minimum number of coins required to make amount i\n    - *index = amount*\n    - *value = min required coins*\n - *set value at index 0 to 0 because 0 coins are required for amount 0*\n - *set the value at other indices to m (value greater than the given amount)*\n- for each amount in the range 1 to m\n    - for each coin\n        - if the remaining amount is not negative\n            - find the min coins required to make that amount using the formula\n                - *min coins to make current amount = min(current value, 1 + min coins to make remaining amount)*\n- if the value at index equal to target amount in the dp array is still m, we couldn't make the target amount using the coins, return -1. Else return dp[target amount] as the minimum coins required\n\n\n## Complexity\n- Time complexity: O(amount * coins) → O(m * n)\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n- Space complexity: O(dp list) → O(amount) → O(m)\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n\n\n## Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Solution:\n\n    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:\n        m = amount + 1\n        dp = [m] * (m)\n        dp[0] = 0\n        for a in range(1, m):\n            for c in coins:\n                if a - c >= 0:\n                    dp[a] = min(dp[a], 1 + dp[a - c])\n        return -1 if dp[amount] == m else dp[amount]","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
