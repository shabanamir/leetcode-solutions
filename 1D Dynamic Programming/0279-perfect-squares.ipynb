Dynamic programming <br>\n","The number of perfect squares that sum to a number x is in range 0 to sqrt(x). We can reach a sum i using a number j as a perfect square if we can reach sum i - j$^2$. So, to solve the main problem we have to solve the sub-problems. Use dynammic programming .\n","\n","2. Lagrange's four-square theorem <br>\n","according to the theorem, any positive number can be represented by at most 4 square number sum. The theorem steps are:\n","    - keep dividing the number by 4 as long as it is divisible\n","    - if after the division by 4, dividing it by 8 results in a remainder of 7, the answer is 4 i.e the number is a sum of four square numbers\n","    - else if any two numbers can square sum to n, the answer is 1 or 2\n","    - else answer is 3\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","**Dynamic Programming Approach**\n","- check base cases\n","    - if n is a perfect square for example 4, 9, 16 etc, return 1\n","- set dp = an array of size n with a default max value (use n or max integer) where dp[i] represents the number of perfect squares that sum to i\n","- set dp[0] to 0 and dp[1] to 1 because the total square numbers that sum to 0 and 1 are 0 and 1 respectively\n","- for each sum i in range 2 to n\n","    - for each perfect square j in range 1 to sqrt(i)\n","        - update dp[i] using the formula\n","            - *(we can reach sum i using the current number j as a perfect square if we can reach sum i - j$^2$)* \n","- return number of perfect squares that sum to n i.e dp[n]\n","    \n","**Math Approach**\n","- check base cases\n","    - if n is a perfect square for example 4, 9, 16 etc, return 1\n","- apply the theorem steps\n","    - loop to keep dividing the number by 4 as long as it is divisible\n","    - if after the division by 4, dividing it by 8 results in a remainder of 7\n","        - return 4\n","    - else if any two numbers can square sum to n, the answer is 1 or 2.
