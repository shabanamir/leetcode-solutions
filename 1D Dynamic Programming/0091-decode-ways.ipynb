At most, we can group two digits if they are inbound. \n","\n","The number of ways to decode a string of size n is the sum of:\n","- no. of ways to decode string of size n-1 if n-1 is not 0\n","- no. of ways to decode string of size n-2 if the number represented by n-1 and n-2 is inbound (i.e 10-26)\n","\n","So, to solve the main problem (n), we need to solve the sub-problems i.e (n-1 and n-2). Use dynamic programming.\n","\n","\n","## Approach\n","<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n","- check base cases\n","    - if there is a leading zero, we can't decode the string, return 0\n","- set n = string size\n","- set dp = a list of size n where dp[i] represents number of ways to decode string of size i\n","    - *index = string size*\n","    - *value = ways to decode*\n","- set the value at index 0 and 1 to 1 because there is 1 way to decode an empty or 1-letter string\n","- traverse the string starting from the third index (2) to keep index inbound\n","    - check for the above two conditions and fill the dp array\n","        - if the last digit is not 0\n","            - update dp[i]\n","        - if the last two digits are inbound (10-26) i.e the second last digit is either 1 or 2 and the last digit is less than 7\n","            - update dp[i]\n","- return the value at index n (last index) as the number of ways to decode the string of size n\n","\n","## Complexity\n","- Time complexity: O(loop) → O(n)\n","<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","- Space complexity: O(dp list) → O(n)\n","<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n","\n","\n","## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","\n","    def numDecodings(self, s: str) -> int:\n","        if s[0] == '0': \n","            return 0\n","        n = len(s)\n","        dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n","        dp[0] = dp[1] = 1          \n","        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n","            if s[i - 1] != '0':\n","                dp[i] += dp[i - 1]\n","            if s[i - 2] == '1' or s[i - 2] == '2' and s[i - 1] < '7':\n","                dp[i] += dp[i - 2]\n","        return dp[n]"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
